1: [wind] [clop clop clop] \\nKING ARTHUR: Whoa there!  [clop clop clop] \\nSOLDIER #1: Halt!  Who goes there? \\nARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of the Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England! \\nSOLDIER #1: Pull the other one! \\nARTHUR: I am, ...  and this is my trusty servant Patsy.  We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot.  I must speak with your lord and master. \\nSOLDIER #1: What?  Ridden on a horse? \\nARTHUR: Yes! \\nSOLDIER #1: You're using coconuts! \\nARTHUR: What? \\nSOLDIER #1: You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together. \\nARTHUR: So?  We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea, through-- \\nSOLDIER #1: Where'd you get the coconuts? \\nARTHUR: We found them. \\nSOLDIER #1: Found them?  In Mercea?  The coconut's tropical! \\nARTHUR: What do you mean? \\nSOLDIER #1: Well, this is a temperate zone. \\nARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land? \\nSOLDIER #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? \\nARTHUR: Not at all.  They could be carried. \\nSOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut? \\nARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk! \\nSOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut. \\nARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here. \\nSOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right? \\nARTHUR: Please! \\nSOLDIER #1: Am I right? \\nARTHUR: I'm not interested! \\nSOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow! \\nSOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.  That's my point. \\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that. \\nARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?! \\nSOLDIER #1: But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory. \\nSOLDIER #2: Oh, yeah... \\nSOLDIER #1: So they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway...  [clop clop clop] \\nSOLDIER #2: Wait a minute!  Supposing two swallows carried it together? \\nSOLDIER #1: No, they'd have to have it on a line. \\nSOLDIER #2: Well, simple!  They'd just use a strand of creeper! \\nSOLDIER #1: What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers? \\nSOLDIER #2: Well, why not? \\nSCENE 2: [thud] [clang] \\nCART-MASTER: Bring out your dead!

Here's your ninepence. \\nDEAD PERSON: I'm not dead! \\nCART-MASTER: 'Ere.  He says he's not dead! \\nCUSTOMER: Yes he is. \\nDEAD PERSON: I'm not! \\nCART-MASTER: He isn't? \\nCUSTOMER: Well, he will be soon.  He's very ill. \\nDEAD PERSON: I'm getting better! \\nCUSTOMER: No you're not.  You'll be stone dead in a moment. \\nCART-MASTER: Oh, I can't take him like that.  It's against regulations. \\nDEAD PERSON: I don't want to go on the cart! \\nCUSTOMER: Oh, don't be such a baby. \\nCART-MASTER: I can't take him. \\nDEAD PERSON: I feel fine! \\nCUSTOMER: Well, do us a favor. \\nCART-MASTER: I can't. \\nCUSTOMER: Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes?  He won't be long. \\nCART-MASTER: No, I've got to go to the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today. \\nCUSTOMER: Well, when's your next round? \\nCART-MASTER: Thursday. \\nDEAD PERSON: I think I'll go for a walk. \\nCUSTOMER: You're not fooling anyone you know.  Look, isn't there something you can do? \\nDEAD PERSON: [singing] I feel happy...  I feel happy.  [whop] \\nCUSTOMER: Ah, thanks very much. \\nCART-MASTER: Not at all.  See you on Thursday. \\nCUSTOMER: Right.  All right.  [howl] [clop clop clop] Who's that then? \\nCART-MASTER: I dunno.  Must be a king. \\nCUSTOMER: Why? \\nCART-MASTER: He hasn't got shit all over him. \\nSCENE 3: [thud] [King Arthur music] [thud thud thud] [King Arthur music stops] \\nARTHUR: Old woman! \\nDENNIS: Man! \\nARTHUR: Man.  Sorry.  What knight live in that castle over there? \\nDENNIS: I'm thirty-seven. \\nARTHUR: I-- what? \\nDENNIS: I'm thirty-seven.  I'm not old. \\nARTHUR: Well, I can't just call you 'Man'. \\nDENNIS: Well, you could say 'Dennis'. \\nARTHUR: Well, I didn't know you were called 'Dennis'. \\nDENNIS: Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you? \\nARTHUR: I did say 'sorry' about the 'old woman', but from the behind you looked-- \\nDENNIS: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior! \\nARTHUR: Well, I am king! \\nDENNIS: Oh king, eh, very nice.  And how d'you get that, eh?  By exploiting the workers!  By 'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society.  If there's ever going to be any progress with the-- \\nWOMAN: Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here.  Oh!  How d'you do? \\nARTHUR: How do you do, good lady.  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.  Who's castle is that? \\nWOMAN: King of the who? \\nARTHUR: The Britons. \\nWOMAN: Who are the Britons? \\nARTHUR: Well, we all are.  We are all Britons, and I am your king. \\nWOMAN: I didn't know we had a king.  I thought we were an autonomous collective. \\nDENNIS: You're fooling yourself.  We're living in a dictatorship.  A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes-- \\nWOMAN: Oh, there you go, bringing class into it again. \\nDENNIS: That's what it's all about.  If only people would hear of-- \\nARTHUR: Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  Who lives in that castle? \\nWOMAN: No one live there. \\nARTHUR: Then who is your lord? \\nWOMAN: We don't have a lord. \\nARTHUR: What? \\nDENNIS: I told you.  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune.  We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. \\nARTHUR: Yes. \\nDENNIS: But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting-- \\nARTHUR: Yes, I see. \\nDENNIS: By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,-- \\nARTHUR: Be quiet! \\nDENNIS: But by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major-- \\nARTHUR: Be quiet!  I order you to be quiet! \\nWOMAN: Order, eh?  Who does he think he is?  Heh. \\nARTHUR: I am your king! \\nWOMAN: Well, I didn't vote for you. \\nARTHUR: You don't vote for kings. \\nWOMAN: Well, how did you become king then? \\nARTHUR: The Lady of the Lake, ... [angels sing] ... her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. [singing stops] That is why I am your king! \\nDENNIS: Listen, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. \\nARTHUR: Be quiet! \\nDENNIS: Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! \\nARTHUR: Shut up! \\nDENNIS: I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away! \\nARTHUR: Shut up, will you.  Shut up! \\nDENNIS: Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system. \\nARTHUR: Shut up! \\nDENNIS: Oh!  Come and see the violence inherent in the system!  Help, help!  I'm being repressed! \\nARTHUR: Bloody peasant! \\nDENNIS: Oh, what a give-away.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear that, eh?  That's what I'm on about.  Did you see him repressing me?  You saw it, didn't you \\nSCENE 4: [King Arthur music] [music stops] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Aaagh!  [King Arthur music] [music stops] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Aaagh! \\nGREEN KNIGHT: Ooh!

Come, Patsy. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: None shall pass. \\nARTHUR: What? \\nBLACK KNIGHT: None shall pass. \\nARTHUR: I have no quarrel with you, good Sir Knight, but I must cross this bridge. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Then you shall die. \\nARTHUR: I command you, as King of the Britons, to stand aside! \\nBLACK KNIGHT: I move for no man. \\nARTHUR: So be it! \\nARTHUR and BLACK KNIGHT: Aaah!, hiyaah!, etc. [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm off] \\nARTHUR: Now stand aside, worthy adversary. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: 'Tis but a scratch. \\nARTHUR: A scratch?  Your arm's off! \\nBLACK KNIGHT: No, it isn't. \\nARTHUR: Well, what's that then? \\nBLACK KNIGHT: I've had worse. \\nARTHUR: You liar! \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Come on, you pansy! [clang] Huyah! [clang] Hiyaah! [clang] Aaaaaaaah! [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right arm off] \\nARTHUR: Victory is mine! [kneeling] We thank Thee Lord, that in Thy mer-- \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Hah! [clunk] Come on then. \\nARTHUR: What? \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Have at you! [kick] \\nARTHUR: Eh.  You are indeed brave, Sir Knight, but the fight is mine. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Oh, had enough, eh? \\nARTHUR: Look, you stupid bastard.  You've got no arms left. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Yes I have. \\nARTHUR: Look! \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Just a flesh wound. [kick] \\nARTHUR: Look, stop that. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Chicken! [kick] Chickennn! \\nARTHUR: Look, I'll have your leg. [kick] Right! [whop] [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right leg off] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Right.  I'll do you for that! \\nARTHUR: You'll what? \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Come here! \\nARTHUR: What are you going to do, bleed on me? \\nBLACK KNIGHT: I'm invincible! \\nARTHUR: You're a looney. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: The Black Knight always triumphs!  Have at you!  Come on then. [whop] [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's last leg off] \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Ooh.  All right, we'll call it a draw. \\nARTHUR: Come, Patsy. \\nBLACK KNIGHT: Oh.  Oh, I see.

I would be honored. \\nARTHUR: What is your name? \\nBEDEVERE: Bedevere, my liege. \\nARTHUR: Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, Knight of the Round Table \\nNARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave; Sir Gallahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table \\nSCENE 6: [clop clop clop] \\nSIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped. \\nARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes. \\nBEDEVERE: Oh, certainly, sir. \\nSIR LAUNCELOT: Look, my liege! [trumpets] \\nARTHUR: Camelot! \\nSIR GALAHAD: Camelot! \\nLAUNCELOT: Camelot! \\nPATSY: It's only a model. \\nARTHUR: Shh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride... to...  Camelot! [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [singing] We're knights of the round table.  We dance when e'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot [dancing] We're knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We're opera mad in Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot [in dungeon] \\nPRISONER: [clap clap clap clap] [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we're tough and able, Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.  It's a busy life in Camelot. \\nMAN: I have to push the pram a lot [outdoors] \\nARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place. \\nKNIGHTS: Right.  Right \\nSCENE 7: [clop clop clop] [boom boom] [angels sing] \\nGOD: Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel! [singing stops] One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling. \\nARTHUR: Sorry. [boom] \\nGOD: And don't apologise.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'. [boom] What are you doing now?! \\nARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, O Lord. \\nGOD: Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing. Now knock it off! \\nARTHUR: Yes, Lord. \\nGOD: Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times. \\nARTHUR: Good idea, O Lord! \\nGOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold! [angels sing] Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.  That is your purpose, Arthur...  the quest for the Holy Grail. [boom] [singing stops] \\nLAUNCELOT: A blessing!  A blessing from the Lord! \\nGALAHAD: God be praised \\nSCENE 8: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] \\nARTHUR: Halt! [horn] Hallo! [pause] Hallo! \\nFRENCH GUARD: Allo!  Who is eet? \\nARTHUR: It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the Round Table.  Who's castle is this? \\nFRENCH GUARD: This is the castle of my master Guy de Loimbard. \\nARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail. \\nFRENCH GUARD: Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.  Uh, he's already got one, you see? \\nARTHUR: What? \\nGALAHAD: He says they've already got one! \\nARTHUR: Are you sure he's got one? \\nFRENCH GUARD: Oh, yes, it's very nice-a.  (I told him we already got one.) \\nARTHUR: Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look? \\nFRENCH GUARD: Of course not!  You are English types-a! \\nARTHUR: Well, what are you then? \\nFRENCH GUARD: I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king-a?! \\nGALAHAD: What are you doing in England? \\nFRENCH GUARD: Mind your own business! \\nARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force! \\nFRENCH GUARD: You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your bottom, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets.  Thpppppt!  Thppt! Thppt! \\nGALAHAD: What a strange person. \\nARTHUR: Now look here, my good man-- \\nFRENCH GUARD: I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! \\nGALAHAD: Is there someone else up there we could talk to? \\nFRENCH GUARD: No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a! [sniff] \\nARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable. \\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache.) \\nOTHER FRENCH GUARD: Quoi? \\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache!) [mooo] \\nARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall-- [twong] [mooooooo] Jesus Christ! \\nKNIGHTS: Christ! [thud] Ah!  Ohh! \\nARTHUR: Right!  Charge! \\nKNIGHTS: Charge! [mayhem] \\nFRENCH GUARD: Hey, this one is for your mother!  There you go. [mayhem] \\nFRENCH GUARD: And this one's for your dad! \\nARTHUR: Run away! \\nKNIGHTS: Run away! \\nFRENCH GUARD: Thppppt! \\nFRENCH GUARDS: [taunting] \\nLAUNCELOT: Fiends!  I'll tear them apart! \\nARTHUR: No, no.  No, no. \\nBEDEVERE: Sir!  I have a plan, sir.

Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed! \\nARTHUR: Who leaps out? \\nBEDEVERE: U-- u-- uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I.  Uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh... \\nARTHUR: Ohh. \\nBEDEVERE: Oh.

Haw haw heh.. \\nSCENE 9: [clack] \\nVOICE: Picture for Schools, take eight. \\nDIRECTOR: Action! \\nHISTORIAN: Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur.  The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. [clop clop clop] Now, this is what they did: Launcelot-- \\nKNIGHT: Aaaah! [slash] [KNIGHT kills HISTORIAN] \\nHISTORIAN'S WIFE: Frank \\nSCENE 10: [trumpets] \\nNARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin.  So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels. \\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.  To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin! \\nHis head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off, And his pen-- \\nSIR ROBIN: That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads.  Heh.  Looks like there's dirty work afoot. \\nDENNIS: Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom. \\nWOMAN: Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  We haven't got enough mud. \\nALL HEADS: Halt!  Who art thou? \\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who-- \\nROBIN: Shut up!  Um, n-- n-- n-- nobody really, I'm j-- j-- j-- ju-- just um, just passing through. \\nALL HEADS: What do you want? \\nMINSTREL: [singing] To fight and-- \\nROBIN: Shut up!  Um, oo, a-- nothing, nothing really.  I, uh, j-- j-- just--just to um, just to p-- pass through, good Sir Knight. \\nALL HEADS: I'm afraid not! \\nROBIN: Ah.  W-- well, actually I-- I am a Knight of the Round Table. \\nALL HEADS: You're a Knight of the Round Table? \\nROBIN: I am. \\nLEFT HEAD: In that case I shall have to kill you. \\nMIDDLE HEAD: Shall I? \\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, I don't think so. \\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well, what do I think? \\nLEFT HEAD: I think kill him. \\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, let's be nice to him. \\nLEFT HEAD: Oh shut up. \\nROBIN: Perhaps I could-- \\nLEFT HEAD: And you.  Oh, quick!  Get the sword out.  I want to cut his headoff! \\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, cut your own head off! \\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes, do us all a favor! \\nLEFT HEAD: What? \\nRIGHT HEAD: Yapping on all the time. \\nMIDDLE HEAD: You're lucky.  You're not next to him. \\nLEFT HEAD: What do you mean? \\nMIDDLE HEAD: You snore! \\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, I don't.  Anyway, you've got bad breath. \\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well it's only because you don't brush my teeth. \\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea. \\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits. \\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes. \\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, not biscuits. \\nLEFT HEAD: All right.  All right, not biscuits, but let's kill him anyway. \\nALL HEADS: Right! \\nMIDDLE HEAD: He buggered off. \\nRIGHT HEAD: So he has.  He's scarper \\nMINSTREL: [singing] Brave Sir Robin ran away. \\nROBIN: No! \\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely ran away away. \\nROBIN: I didn't! \\nMINSTREL: [singing] When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled. \\nROBIN: No! \\nMINSTREL: [singing] Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about \\nROBIN: I didn't! \\nMINSTREL: [singing] And gallantly he chickened out, bravely taking to his feet. \\nROBIN: I never did! \\nMINSTREL: [singing] He beat a very brave retreat. \\nROBIN: All lies! \\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin. \\nROBIN: I never \\nCARTOON MONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. \\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Heh heh heeh ooh...

Open the door! [pound pound pound] In the name of King Arthur, open the door! [squeak] [thump] [squeak] [boom] \\nGIRLS: Hello! \\nZOOT: Welcome gentle Sir Knight.  Welcome to the Castle Anthrax. \\nGALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax? \\nZOOT: Yes.  Oh, it's not a very good name is it?  Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need! \\nGALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail? \\nZOOT: The what? \\nGALAHAD: The Grail.  It is here. \\nZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!  Crapper! \\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Yes, O Zoot? \\nZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest. \\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Oh thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you! ... \\nZOOT: Away, away varletesses.  The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big. \\nGALAHAD: Well, look, I-- I-- uh-- \\nZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight? \\nGALAHAD: Sir Galahad...  the Chaste. \\nZOOT: Mine is Zoot.  Just Zoot.  Oh, but come. \\nGALAHAD: Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail! \\nZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much.  You are delirious. \\nGALAHAD: No, look.  I have seen it!  It is here, in this-- \\nZOOT: Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality. \\nGALAHAD: Well, I-- I-- uh-- \\nZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.  We are just not used to handsome knights.  Nay.  Nay.  Come.  Come.  You may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded! \\nGALAHAD: No, no-- it's-- it's nothing. \\nZOOT: Oh, you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please!  Lie down. [clap clap] \\nPIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble? \\nGALAHAD: They're doctors?! \\nZOOT: Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes. \\nGALAHAD: B-- but-- \\nZOOT: Oh, come, come.  You must try to rest.  Doctor Piglet!  Doctor Winston!  Practice your art. \\nWINSTON: Try to relax. \\nGALAHAD: Are you sure that's absolutely necessary? \\nPIGLET: We must examine you. \\nGALAHAD: There's nothing wrong with that! \\nPIGLET: Please.  We are doctors. \\nGALAHAD: Look!  This cannot be.  I am sworn to chastity. \\nPIGLET: Back to your bed!  At once! \\nGALAHAD: Torment me no longer.  I have seen the Grail! \\nPIGLET: There's no grail here. \\nGALAHAD: I have seen it!  I have seen it! [clank] I have seen-- \\nGIRLS: Hello. \\nGALAHAD: Oh. \\nGIRLS: Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

I have seen it, here in this castle! \\nDINGO: Oh no.  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot! \\nGALAHAD: Well, what is it? \\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It's not the first time we've had this problem. \\nGALAHAD: It's not the real Grail? \\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  She is a bad person and must pay the penalty.  Do you think this scene should have been cut?  We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we're glad.  It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think. \\nLEFT HEAD: At least ours was better visually. \\nDENNIS: Well, at least ours was committed.  It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes. \\nOLD MAN: Get on with it. \\nTIM THE ENCHANTER: Yes, get on with it! \\nARMY OF KNIGHTS: Yes, get on with it! \\nDINGO: Oh, I am enjoying this scene. \\nGOD: Get on with it! \\nDINGO: [sigh] Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.  Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You must tie her down on a bed and spank her. \\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking! \\nDINGO: You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me. \\nAMAZING: And spank me. \\nSTUNNER: And me. \\nLOVELY: And me. \\nDINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking! \\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!  There is going to be a spanking tonight! \\nDINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex. \\nGIRLS: The oral sex!  The oral sex! \\nGALAHAD: Well, I could stay a bit longer. \\nLAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad! \\nGALAHAD: Oh, hello. \\nLAUNCELOT: Quick! \\nGALAHAD: What? \\nLAUNCELOT: Quick! \\nGALAHAD: Why? \\nLAUNCELOT: You are in great peril! \\nDINGO: No he isn't. \\nLAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress! \\nGALAHAD: You know, she's got a point. \\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!  We will cover your escape! \\nGALAHAD: Look, I'm fine! \\nLAUNCELOT: Come on! \\nGIRLS: Sir Galahad! \\nGALAHAD: No.  Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed! \\nDINGO: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed! \\nGIRLS: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed! \\nLAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad.  Come on! \\nGALAHAD: No!  Really!  Honestly, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily. \\nDINGO: Oh, yes.  Let him handle us easily. \\nGIRLS: Yes.  Let him handle us easily. \\nLAUNCELOT: No.  Quick!  Quick! \\nGALAHAD: Please!  I can defeat them!  There's only a hundred-and-fifty of them! \\nDINGO: Yes, yes!  He will beat us easily!  We haven't a chance. \\nGIRLS: We haven't a chance.  He will beat us easily... [boom] \\nDINGO: Oh, shit. \\nLAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril. \\nGALAHAD: I don't think I was. \\nLAUNCELOT: Yes you were.  You were in terrible peril. \\nGALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril. \\nLAUNCELOT: No, it's too perilous. \\nGALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can. \\nLAUNCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on! \\nGALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril? \\nLAUNCELOT: No.  It's unhealthy. \\nGALAHAD: I bet you're gay. \\nLAUNCELOT: No I'm not \\nNARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.  Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.  I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them.  I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging-- \\nCROWD: Get on with it! \\nNARRATOR: Oh, anyway.  On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh \\nSCENE 12: \\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee ha ha hee hee!  Hee hee hee ha ha ha... \\nARTHUR: And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail? \\nOLD MAN: ... Ha ha ha ha!  Heh, hee ha ha hee!  Ha hee ha!

He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered. \\nARTHUR: And the Grail.  The Grail is there? \\nOLD MAN: There is much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed. \\nARTHUR: But the Grail!  Where is the Grail?! \\nOLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death. \\nARTHUR: The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail? \\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee hee hee hee!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Hee ha ha.. \\nSCENE 13: [spooky music] [music stops] \\nHEAD KNIGHT OF NI: Ni! \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni! \\nARTHUR: Who are you? \\nHEAD KNIGHT: We are the Knights Who Say...

All that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys of this land!  This'll be your kingdom, lad. \\nHERBERT: But Mother-- \\nFATHER: Father, lad.  Father. \\nHERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that. \\nFATHER: Listen, lad.  I built this kingdom up from nothing.  When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands. \\nHERBERT: But I don't want any of that.  I'd rather-- \\nFATHER: Rather what?! \\nHERBERT: I'd rather... [music] ... just...  sing! \\nFATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  You're not going into a song while I'm here.  Now listen, lad.

She's got huge...  tracts o' land. \\nHERBERT: I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have...  [music] ... a certain...  special...  something! \\nFATHER: Cut that out!  Cut that out!

Make sure 'e doesn't leave. \\nGUARD #1: Oh, yes, of course. \\nGUARD #2: Hic! \\nGUARD #1: Ah.  I thought you meant him.  You know, it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard. \\nFATHER: Is that clear? \\nGUARD #2: Hic! \\nGUARD #1: Oh, quite clear.  No problems. \\nFATHER: Right.  Where are you going? \\nGUARD #1: We're coming with you. \\nFATHER: No, no.  I want you to stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave. \\nGUARD #1: Oh, I see.  Right. \\nHERBERT: But Father! \\nFATHER: Shut your noise, you!  And get that suit on! [music] And no singing! \\nGUARD #2: Hic! \\nFATHER: Oh, go and get a glass of water. [clank] [scribble scribble scribble fold fold] [twong] \\nSCENE 15: \\nLAUNCELOT: Well taken, Concorde! \\nCONCORDE: Thank you, sir!  Most kind. \\nLAUNCELOT: And again!  Over we go!  Good.  Steady!  And now, the big one!  Uuh!  Come on, Concorde! [thwonk] \\nCONCORDE: Message for you, sir. [fwump] \\nLAUNCELOT: Concorde!  Concorde!  Speak to me!  'To whoever finds this note: I have been imprisoned by my father, who wishes me to marry against my will.  Please, please, please come and rescue me.  I am in the Tall Tower of Swamp Castle.' At last!  A call!  A cry of distress!  This could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!  Brave, brave Concorde, you shall not have died in vain! \\nCONCORDE: Uh, I'm-- I'm not quite dead, sir. \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, you shall not have been mortally wounded in vain! \\nCONCORDE: I-- I-- I think I c-- I could pull through, sir. \\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, I see. \\nCONCORDE: Actually, I think I'm all right to come with you, sir-- \\nLAUNCELOT: No, no, sweet Concorde!  Stay here!  I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular...  [sigh] \\nCONCORDE: Idiom, sir? \\nLAUNCELOT: Idiom! \\nCONCORDE: No, I feel fine, actually, sir. \\nLAUNCELOT: Farewell, sweet Concorde! \\nCONCORDE: I'll, um, I'll just stay here then.  Shall I, sir?  Yeah \\nSCENE 16: [inside castle] \\nPRINCESS LUCKY and GIRLS: [giggle giggle giggle] [outside castle] \\nGUEST: 'Morning! \\nSENTRY #1: 'Morning. \\nSENTRY #2: Oooh. \\nSENTRY #1: [ptoo] \\nLAUNCELOT: Ha ha!  Hiyya! \\nSENTRY #2: Hey! \\nLAUNCELOT: Hiyya!, Ha!, etc. \\nPRINCESS LUCKY and GIRLS: [giggle giggle giggle] \\nLAUNCELOT: Ha ha!  Huy! \\nGUESTS: Uuh!  Aaah! \\nLAUNCELOT: Ha ha!  And take this!  Aah!  Hiyah!  Aah!  Aaah!  Hyy!  Hya!  Hiyya!  Ha! ... \\nGUARD #1: Now, you're not allowed to enter the room-- aaugh! \\nLAUNCELOT: O fair one, behold your humble servant Sir Launcelot of Camelot.  I have come to take y-- Oh, I'm terribly sorry. \\nHERBERT: You got my note! \\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, well, I-- I got a-- a note. \\nHERBERT: You've come to rescue me! \\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, well, no.  You see, I hadn't-- \\nHERBERT: I knew someone would.  I knew that somewhere out there...  [music] \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I-- \\nHERBERT: ... there must be...  someone... \\nFATHER: Stop that!  Stop that!  Stop it!  Stop it!  Who are you? \\nHERBERT: I'm your son! \\nFATHER: No, not you. \\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am Sir Launcelot, sir. \\nHERBERT: He's come to rescue me, Father. \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, let's not jump to conclusions. \\nFATHER: Did you kill all those guards? \\nLAUNCELOT: Uh...  Oh, yes.  Sorry. \\nFATHER: They cost fifty pounds each! \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I'm awfully sorry.  Um, I really can explain everything. \\nHERBERT: Don't be afraid of him, Sir Launcelot.  I've got a rope all ready. \\nFATHER: You killed eight wedding guests in all! \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, uh, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a lady. \\nFATHER: I can understand that. \\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!  Hurry! \\nFATHER: Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father, that's all! \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I really didn't mean to... \\nFATHER: Didn't mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head! \\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, dear.  Is he all right? \\nFATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a fortune! \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see-- \\nFATHER: Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot? \\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot! \\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir. \\nFATHER: Very nice castle, Camelot.  Uh, very good pig country... \\nLAUNCELOT: Is it? \\nHERBERT: Hurry!  I'm ready! \\nFATHER: Would you, uh, like to come and have a drink? \\nLAUNCELOT: Well, that-- that's, uh, awfully nice of you, ... \\nHERBERT: I am ready! \\nLAUNCELOT: ... um, I mean to be so understanding. [thonk] Um, ... [woosh] \\nHERBERT: Oooh! \\nLAUNCELOT: ... I'm afraid when I'm in this idiom, I sometimes get a bit, uh, sort of carried away. \\nFATHER: Oh, don't worry about that. \\nHERBERT: Oooh! [splat] \\nSCENE 17: \\nGUESTS: [crying] \\nFATHER: Well, this is the main hall.  We're going to have all this knocked through, and made into one big, uh, living room. \\nGUEST: There he is! \\nFATHER: Oh, bloody hell. \\nLAUNCELOT: Ha ha ha!  Hey!  Ha ha! \\nFATHER: Hold it!  Stop it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Hold it!  Please! \\nLAUNCELOT: Sorry.  Sorry.  You see what I mean?  I just get carried away.  I'm really most awfully sorry.  Sorry!  Sorry, everyone. \\nGUEST #1: He's killed the best man! \\nGUESTS: [yelling] \\nFATHER: Hold it!  Hold it!  Please!  Hold it!  This is Sir Launcelot from the Court of Camelot, a very brave and influential knight, and my special guest here today. \\nLAUNCELOT: Hello. \\nGUEST: He killed my auntie! \\nGUESTS: [yelling] \\nFATHER: Please!  Please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!  Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.  We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death. \\nGUESTS: Oh!  Oh no! \\nFATHER: But I don't want to think I've not lost a son, so much as...  gained a daughter! [clap clap clap] For, since the tragic death of her father-- \\nGUEST #2: He's not quite dead! \\nFATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father-- \\nGUEST #2: He's getting better! \\nFATHER: For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him. \\nBRIDE'S FATHER: Uugh! \\nGUEST #2: Oh, he's died! \\nFATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense. [clap clap clap] And I feel sure that the merger-- er, the union between the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Launcelot of Camelot-- \\nLAUNCELOT: What? \\nGUEST #2: Look!  The dead Prince! \\nGUESTS: Oooh!  The dead Prince! \\nCONCORDE: He's not quite dead. \\nHERBERT: No, I feel much better. \\nFATHER: You fell out of the Tall Tower, you creep! \\nHERBERT: No, I was saved at the last minute. \\nFATHER: How?! \\nHERBERT: Well, I'll tell you. [music] \\nFATHER: Not like that!  Not like that!  No!  Stop it! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ... \\nFATHER: Shut uuup! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ... \\nFATHER: Shut up! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ... \\nFATHER: Shut up! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ... \\nFATHER: Not like that! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell!  He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ... \\nCONCORDE: Quickly, sir! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ... \\nCONCORDE: Come this way! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ... \\nLAUNCELOT: No!  It's not right for my idiom! \\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell about his great escape... \\nLAUNCELOT: I must escape more...  [sigh] \\nGUESTS: [singing] Oh, he fell a long, long way... \\nCONCORDE: Dramatically, sir? \\nLAUNCELOT: Dramatically! \\nGUESTS: [singing] But he's here with us today... \\nLAUNCELOT: Heee!  Hoa! [crash] Hoo! \\nGUESTS: [singing] What a wonderful escape! \\nLAUNCELOT: Excuse me.  Could, uh-- could somebody give me a push, please \\nSCENE 18: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] [rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!] \\nARTHUR: Old crone! [rewr!] [music stops] Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery? [dramatic chord] \\nOLD CRONE: Who sent you? \\nARTHUR: The Knights Who Say 'Ni'. \\nCRONE: Aggh!  No!  Never!  We have no shrubberies here. \\nARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say...  we will say...  'ni'. \\nCRONE: Agh!  Do your worst! \\nARTHUR: Very well!  If you will not assist us voluntarily, ...  ni! \\nCRONE: No!  Never!  No shrubberies! \\nARTHUR: Ni! \\nCRONE: [cough] \\nBEDEVERE: Nu! \\nARTHUR: No, no, no, no... \\nBEDEVERE: Nu! \\nARTHUR: No, it's not that, it's 'ni'. \\nBEDEVERE: Nu! \\nARTHUR: No, no-- 'ni'.  You're not doing it properly.  No. \\nBEDEVERE: Ni! \\nARTHUR and BEDEVERE: Ni! \\nARTHUR: That's it.  That's it.  You've got it. \\nARTHUR and BEDEVERE: Ni! \\nCRONE: Ohh! \\nBEDEVERE: Ni! \\nARTHUR: Ni! \\nCRONE: Agh! \\nBEDEVERE: Ni! \\nARTHUR: Ni! \\nBEDEVERE: Ni! \\nARTHUR: Ni! \\nBEDEVERE: Ni! \\nROGER THE SHRUBBER: Are you saying 'ni' to that old woman? \\nARTHUR: Erm, yes. \\nROGER: Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can 'ni' at will to old ladies.  There is a pestilence upon this land.  Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history. \\nARTHUR: Did you say 'shrubberies'? \\nROGER: Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies. \\nBEDEVERE: Ni! \\nARTHUR: No!  No, no, no!  No \\nSCENE 19: \\nARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we go now? \\nHEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.  But there is one small problem. \\nARTHUR: What is that? \\nHEAD KNIGHT: We are now...  no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'. \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Shh! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Shh!  We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zoo-owli-zhiv'. \\nRANDOM: Ni! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test. \\nARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently Said 'Ni'? \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find...  another shrubbery! [dramatic chord] \\nARTHUR: Not another shrubbery! \\nRANDOM: Ni! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle. \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: A path!  A path!  A path!  Ni!  Shh!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Shh!  Shh! ... \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...  with...  a herring! [dramatic chord] \\nARTHUR: We shall do no such thing! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Oh, please! \\nARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done. \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaugh!  Aaaugh! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Augh!  Ohh!  Don't say that word. \\nARTHUR: What word? \\nHEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear. \\nARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is? \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: You said it again! \\nARTHUR: What, 'is'? \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Agh!  No, not 'is'. \\nHEAD KNIGHT: No, not 'is'.  You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'. \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: No, not 'is'.  Not 'is'. \\nBEDEVERE: My liege, it's Sir Robin! \\nMINSTREL: [singing] Packing it in and packing it up, And sneaking away and buggering up, And chickening out and pissing off home, Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge. \\nARTHUR: Sir Robin! \\nROBIN: My liege!  It's good to see you. \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Now he's said the word! \\nARTHUR: Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail? \\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is sneaking away and buggering up-- \\nROBIN: Shut up!  No, no.  No.  Far from it. \\nHEAD KNIGHT: He said the word again! \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh! \\nROBIN: I was looking for it. \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh! \\nROBIN: Uh, here-- here in this forest. \\nARTHUR: No, it is far from this place. \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Aaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!  The word... \\nARTHUR: Oh, stop it! \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: ... we cannot hear! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Ow!  He said it again! \\nARTHUR: Patsy! \\nHEAD KNIGHT: Wait!  I said it!  I said it! [clop clop clop] Ooh!  I said it again!  And there again!  That's three 'it's!  Ohh! \\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh \\nNARRATOR: And so, Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.  Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing. \\nKNIGHTS: Yay!  Yay! [woosh] \\nNARRATOR: In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels. \\nMINSTREL: [high-pitched] Get back!  Eee! \\nNARRATOR: And there was much rejoicing. \\nKNIGHTS: Yay! \\nNARRATOR: A year passed. \\nCARTOON CHARACTER: [shivering] \\nNARRATOR: Winter changed into Spring. \\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Mmm, nice. \\nNARRATOR: Spring changed into Summer. \\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Oh.  Ahh. \\nNARRATOR: Summer changed back into Winter. \\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Oh? \\nNARRATOR: And Winter gave Spring and Summer a miss and went straight on into Autumn. \\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Aah. [snap] Oh!  Waa! \\nNARRATOR: Until one day.. \\nSCENE 20: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] [music stops] [boom] \\nKNIGHTS: Eh.  Oh.  See it?  Oh.  Oh. \\nARTHUR: Knights!  Forward! [boom boom boom boom boom] [squeak] [boom boom boom boom] What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without flint or tinder? \\nTIM THE ENCHANTER: I...  am an enchanter. \\nARTHUR: By what name are you known? \\nTIM: There are some who call me...  Tim? \\nARTHUR: Greetings, Tim the Enchanter. \\nTIM: Greetings, King Arthur! \\nARTHUR: You know my name? \\nTIM: I do. [zoosh] You seek the Holy Grail! \\nARTHUR: That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden, O Tim. \\nTIM: Quite. [pweeng boom] [clap clap clap] \\nROBIN: Oh. \\nARTHUR: Yes, we're-- we're looking for the Holy Grail.  Our quest is to find the Holy Grail. \\nKNIGHTS: Yeah.  Yes.  It is.  It is.  Yeah.  Yup.  Yup.  Hm. \\nARTHUR: And so we're-- we're-- we're-- we're looking for it. \\nBEDEVERE: Yes, we are. \\nGALAHAD: Yeah. \\nROBIN: We are.  We are. \\nBEDEVERE: We have been for some time. \\nROBIN: Ages. \\nBEDEVERE: Umhm. \\nARTHUR: Uh-- uh, so, uh, anything that you could do to, uh-- to help, would be...  very...  helpful. \\nGALAHAD: Look, can you tell us where-- [boom] \\nARTHUR: Fine.  Um, I don't want to waste any more of your time, but, uh, I don't suppose you could, uh, tell us where we might find a, um-- find a, uh-- a, um-- a, uh-- \\nTIM: A what...? \\nARTHUR: A g-- a-- a g-- a g-- a-- a g-- \\nTIM: A grail?! \\nARTHUR: Yes, I think so. \\nROBIN: Y-- y-- yes. \\nARTHUR: Yes. \\nGALAHAD: Yup. \\nKNIGHTS: That's it... \\nTIM: Yes! \\nROBIN: Oh. \\nARTHUR: Oh.  Thank you. \\nROBIN: Ahh. \\nGALAHAD: Oh.  Fine. \\nARTHUR: Thank you. \\nROBIN: Splendid. \\nKNIGHTS: Aah... [boom pweeng boom boom] \\nARTHUR: Look, um, you're a busy man, uh-- \\nTIM: Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail. \\nKNIGHTS: Oh, thank you.  Oh... \\nTIM: To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... [boom] ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail. \\nARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim? \\nTIM: Follow.  But!  Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair.  So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth. \\nARTHUR: What an eccentric performance \\nSCENE 21: [clop clop clop] [whinny whinny] \\nGALAHAD: They're nervous, sire. \\nARTHUR: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.  Dis-mount! \\nTIM: Behold the cave of Caerbannog! \\nARTHUR: Right!  Keep me covered. \\nGALAHAD: What with? \\nARTHUR: W-- just keep me covered. \\nTIM: Too late! [dramatic chord] \\nARTHUR: What? \\nTIM: There he is! \\nARTHUR: Where? \\nTIM: There! \\nARTHUR: What, behind the rabbit? \\nTIM: It is the rabbit! \\nARTHUR: You silly sod! \\nTIM: What? \\nARTHUR: You got us all worked up! \\nTIM: Well, that's no ordinary rabbit. \\nARTHUR: Ohh. \\nTIM: That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on. \\nROBIN: You tit!  I soiled my armor I was so scared! \\nTIM: Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide; it's a killer! \\nGALAHAD: Get stuffed! \\nTIM: He'll do you up a treat mate! \\nGALAHAD: Oh, yeah? \\nROBIN: You mangy scots git! \\nTIM: I'm warning you! \\nROBIN: What's he do, nibble your bum? \\nTIM: He's got huge, sharp-- eh-- he can leap about-- look at the bones! \\nARTHUR: Go on, Bors.  Chop his head off! \\nBORS: Right!  Silly little bleeder.  One rabbit stew comin' right up! \\nTIM: Look! [squeak] \\nBORS: Aaaugh! [dramatic chord] [clunk] \\nARTHUR: Jesus Christ! \\nTIM: I warned you! \\nROBIN: I done it again! \\nTIM: I warned you, but did you listen to me?  Oh, no, you knew it all, didn't you?  Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it?  Well, it's always the same.  I always tell them-- \\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up! \\nTIM: Do they listen to me? \\nARTHUR: Right! \\nTIM: Oh, no... \\nKNIGHTS: Charge! [squeak squeak squeak] \\nKNIGHTS: Aaaaugh!, Aaaugh!, etc. \\nARTHUR: Run away!  Run away! \\nKNIGHTS: Run away!  Run away! ... \\nTIM: Ha ha ha ha!  Ha haw haw!  Ha!  Ha ha! \\nARTHUR: Right.  How many did we lose? \\nLAUNCELOT: Gawain. \\nGALAHAD: Ector. \\nARTHUR: And Bors.  That's five. \\nGALAHAD: Three, sir. \\nARTHUR: Three.  Three.  And we'd better not risk another frontal assault.  That rabbit's dynamite. \\nROBIN: Would it help to confuse it if we run away more? \\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up and go and change your armor. \\nGALAHAD: Let us taunt it!  It may become so cross that it will make a mistake. \\nARTHUR: Like what? \\nGALAHAD: Well...  ooh. \\nLAUNCELOT: Have we got bows? \\nARTHUR: No. \\nLAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade. \\nARTHUR: Yes, of course!  The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch!  'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him!  Brother Maynard!  Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade! \\nMONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, donaeis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  Pie Iesu domine, dona eisrequiem. \\nARTHUR: How does it, um-- how does it work? \\nLAUNCELOT: I know not, my liege. \\nARTHUR: Consult the Book of Armaments! \\nBROTHER MAYNARD: Armaments, Chapter Two, verses Nine to Twenty-one. \\nSECOND BROTHER: And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou mayest blow thine enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu-- \\nMAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother. \\nSECOND BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.  Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.' \\nMAYNARD: Amen. \\nKNIGHTS: Amen. \\nARTHUR: Right!  One...  two...  five! \\nGALAHAD: Three, sir! \\nARTHUR: Three! [angels sing] [boom] \\nSCENE 22: \\nARTHUR: There!  Look! \\nLAUNCELOT: What does it say? \\nGALAHAD: What language is that? \\nARTHUR: Brother Maynard!  You are a scholar. \\nMAYNARD: It's Aramaic! \\nGALAHAD: Of course!  Joseph of Arimathea! \\nLAUNCELOT: 'Course! \\nARTHUR: What does it say? \\nMAYNARD: It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh'. \\nARTHUR: What? \\nMAYNARD: '...  the Castle of uuggggggh'. \\nBEDEVERE: What is that? \\nMAYNARD: He must have died while carving it. \\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, come on! \\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what it says. \\nARTHUR: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaggggh'.  He'd just say it! \\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what's carved in the rock! \\nGALAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating. \\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else? \\nMAYNARD: No.  Just, 'uuggggggh'. \\nLAUNCELOT: Aauuggghhh. \\nARTHUR: Aaauggh. \\nBEDEVERE: Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue? \\nGALAHAD: Where's that? \\nBEDEVERE: France, I think. \\nLAUNCELOT: Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall? \\nARTHUR: No, that's Saint Ives. \\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, yes.  Saint Iiiives. \\nKNIGHTS: Iiiiives. \\nBEDEVERE: Oooohoohohooo! \\nLAUNCELOT: No, no.  'Aauuuuugh', at the back of the throat.  Aauuugh. \\nBEDEVERE: N-- no.  No, no, no, no.  'Oooooooh', in surprise and alarm. \\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, you mean sort of a 'aaaah'! \\nBEDEVERE: Yes, but I-- aaaaaah! \\nARTHUR: Oooh! \\nGALAHAD: My God! [dramatic chord] [roar] \\nMAYNARD: It's the legendary Black Beast of Aaauugh! [Black Beast of Aaauugh eats BROTHER MAYNARD] \\nBEDEVERE: That's it!  That's it! \\nARTHUR: Run away! \\nKNIGHTS: Run away! [roar] Run away!  Run awaaay!  Run awaaaaay! [roar] Keep running! [boom] [roar] Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh!  Shh! ... \\nBEDEVERE: We've lost him. [roar] \\nKNIGHTS: Aagh! \\nNARRATOR: As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack. \\nANIMATOR: Ulk! [thump] \\nNARRATOR: The cartoon peril was no more.  The quest for Holy Grail could continue. \\nSCENE 23: [gurgle] \\nGALAHAD: There it is! \\nARTHUR: The Bridge of Death! \\nROBIN: Oh, great. \\nARTHUR: Look!  There's the old man from scene twenty-four! \\nBEDEVERE: What is he doing here? \\nARTHUR: He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death.  He asks each traveller five questions-- \\nGALAHAD: Three questions. \\nARTHUR: Three questions.  He who answers the five questions-- \\nGALAHAD: Three questions. \\nARTHUR: Three questions may cross in safety. \\nROBIN: What if you get a question wrong? \\nARTHUR: Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. \\nROBIN: Oh, I won't go. \\nGALAHAD: Who's going to answer the questions? \\nARTHUR: Sir Robin! \\nROBIN: Yes? \\nARTHUR: Brave Sir Robin, you go. \\nROBIN: Hey!  I've got a great idea.  Why doesn't Launcelot go? \\nLAUNCELOT: Yes.  Let me go, my liege.  I will take him single-handed.  I shall make a feint to the north-east that s-- \\nARTHUR: No, no.

is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. \\nNumerous books have been written about debugging (see below: #Further reading|Further reading), as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, Logfile|log files, monitoring (Application monitoring|application, System Monitoring|system), memory dumps, Profiling (computer programming)|profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. \\nOrigin \\nA computer log entry from the Mark&nbsp;II, with a moth taped to the page \\nThe terms \"bug\" and \"debugging\" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s.[http://foldoc.org/Grace+Hopper Grace Hopper]  from FOLDOC While she was working on a Harvard Mark II|Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were \"debugging\" the system. However the term \"bug\" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion), and \"debugging\" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers. Indeed, in an interview Grace Hopper remarked that she was not coining the term{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The moth fit the already existing terminology, so it was saved.  A letter from J. Robert Oppenheimer (director of the WWII atomic bomb \"Manhattan\" project at Los Alamos, NM) used the term in a letter to Dr. Ernest Lawrence at UC Berkeley, dated October 27, 1944,http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/physics/images/bigscience25.jpg regarding the recruitment of additional technical staff. \\nThe Oxford English Dictionary entry for \"debug\" quotes the term \"debugging\" used in reference to airplane engine testing in a 1945 article in the Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society. An article in \"Airforce\" (June 1945 p.&nbsp;50) also refers to debugging, this time of aircraft cameras.  Hopper\\'s computer bug|bug was found on September 9, 1947. The term was not adopted by computer programmers until the early 1950s. \\nThe seminal article by GillS. Gill, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/98663 The Diagnosis of Mistakes in Programmes on the EDSAC], Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 206, No. 1087 (May 22, 1951), pp. 538-554 in 1951 is the earliest in-depth discussion of programming errors, but it does not use the term \"bug\" or \"debugging\". \\nIn the Association for Computing Machinery|ACM\\'s digital library, the term \"debugging\" is first used in three papers from 1952 ACM National Meetings.Robert V. D.

The words \"anomaly\" and \"discrepancy\" can be used, as being more neutral terms, to avoid the words \"error\" and \"defect\" or \"bug\" where there might be an implication that all so-called \\'\\'errors\\'\\', \\'\\'defects\\'\\' or \\'\\'bugs\\'\\' must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment can be made to determine if changes to remove an \\'\\'anomaly\\'\\' (or \\'\\'discrepancy\\'\\') would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the change(s) unnecessary. Not all issues are life-critical or mission-critical in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long-term, than living with the known problem(s) (where the \"cure would be worse than the disease\"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a \"zero-defects\" mandate, where people might be tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero \\'\\'defects\\'\\'. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same \"bugs\" occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system. \\nTools \\nDebugging on video game consoles is usually done with special hardware such as this Xbox (console)|Xbox debug unit intended for developers. \\nDebugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates.  The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language(s) used and the available tools, such as \\'\\'debuggers\\'\\'. Debuggers are software tools which enable the programmer to monitor the execution (computers)|execution of a program, stop it, restart it, set breakpoints, and change values in memory. The term \\'\\'debugger\\'\\' can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging. \\nGenerally, high-level programming languages, such as Java (programming language)|Java, make debugging easier, because they have features such as exception handling that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot. In programming languages such as C (programming language)|C or assembly language|assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and it is often difficult to see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugging|memory debugger tools may be needed. \\nIn certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful.  These take the form of \\'\\'List of tools for static code analysis|static code analysis tools\\'\\'.  These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code.  All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers.  Some tools claim to be able to detect 300+ unique problems. Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages.  These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs.  A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs \\'\\'before\\'\\' the variable is assigned a value.  Another example would be to perform strong type checking when the language does not require such.  Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors.  As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives.  The old Unix \\'\\'Lint programming tool|lint\\'\\' program is an early example. \\nFor debugging electronic hardware (e.g., computer hardware) as well as low-level software (e.g., BIOSes, device drivers) and firmware, instruments such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers or in-circuit emulator|in-circuit emulators (ICEs) are often used, alone or in combination.  An ICE may perform many of the typical software debugger\\'s tasks on low-level software and firmware. \\nDebugging process \\nNormally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with Parallel computing|parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem. \\nAfter the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it Crash (computing)|crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be made manually, using a Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a Graphical user interface|GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear. \\nAfter the test case is sufficiently simplified, a programmer can use a debugger tool to examine program states (values of variables, plus the call stack) and track down the origin of the problem(s). Alternatively, Tracing (software)|tracing can be used. In simple cases, tracing is just a few print statements, which output the values of variables at certain points of program execution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} \\nTechniques \\n\\'\\'Interactive debugging\\'\\' \\n\\'\\'{{visible anchor|Print debugging}}\\'\\' (or tracing) is the act of watching (live or recorded) trace statements, or print statements, that indicate the flow of execution of a process. This is sometimes called \\'\\'{{visible anchor|printf debugging}}\\'\\', due to the use of the printf function in C. This kind of debugging was turned on by the command TRON in the original versions of the novice-oriented BASIC programming language. TRON stood for, \"Trace On.\" TRON caused the line numbers of each BASIC command line to print as the program ran. \\n\\'\\'Remote debugging\\'\\' is the process of debugging a program running on a system different from the debugger. To start remote debugging, a debugger connects to a remote system over a network. The debugger can then control the execution of the program on the remote system and retrieve information about its state. \\n\\'\\'Post-mortem debugging\\'\\' is debugging of the program after it has already Crash (computing)|crashed. Related techniques often include various tracing techniques (for example,[http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/185300443 Postmortem Debugging, Stephen Wormuller, Dr. Dobbs Journal, 2006]) and/or analysis of memory dump (or core dump) of the crashed process. The dump of the process could be obtained automatically by the system (for example, when process has terminated due to an unhandled exception), or by a programmer-inserted instruction, or manually by the interactive user. \\n\\'\\'\"Wolf fence\" algorithm:\\'\\' Edward Gauss described this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: \"There\\'s one wolf in Alaska; how do you find it? First build a fence down the middle of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point where you can see the wolf.\"<ref name=\"communications of the ACM\">{{cite journal | title=\"Pracniques: The \"Wolf Fence\" Algorithm for Debugging\", | author=E. J. Gauss | year=1982}} This is implemented e.g. in the Git (software)|Git version control system as the command \\'\\'git bisect\\'\\', which uses the above algorithm to determine which Commit (data management)|commit introduced a particular bug. \\n\\'\\'Delta Debugging\\'\\'{{snd}} a technique of automating test case simplification.Andreas Zeller: <cite>Why Programs Fail: A Guide to Systematic Debugging</cite>, Morgan Kaufmann, 2005.

Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application. Not only does this fact make life tough for embedded system developers, it also makes debugging and testing of these systems harder as well, since different debugging tools are needed in different platforms. \\nto identify and fix bugs in the system (e.g. logical or synchronization problems in the code, or a design error in the hardware); \\nto collect information about the operating states of the system that may then be used to analyze the system: to find ways to boost its performance or to optimize other important characteristics (e.g. energy consumption, reliability, real-time response etc.). \\nAnti-debugging \\nAnti-debugging is \"the implementation of one or more techniques within computer code that hinders attempts at reverse engineering or debugging a target process\".<ref name=\"veracode-antidebugging\">{{cite web |url=http://www.veracode.com/blog/2008/12/anti-debugging-series-part-i/ |title=Anti-Debugging Series - Part I |last=Shields |first=Tyler |date=2008-12-02 |work=Veracode |accessdate=2009-03-17}} It is actively used by recognized publishers in copy protection|copy-protection schemas, but is also used by malware to complicate its detection and elimination.<ref name=\"soft-prot\">[http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~mgagnon/software_protection_through_anti_debugging.pdf Software Protection through Anti-Debugging Michael N Gagnon, Stephen Taylor, Anup Ghosh] Techniques used in anti-debugging include: \\nAPI-based: check for the existence of a debugger using system information \\nException-based: check to see if exceptions are interfered with \\nProcess and thread blocks: check whether process and thread blocks have been manipulated \\nModified code: check for code modifications made by a debugger handling software breakpoints \\nHardware- and register-based: check for hardware breakpoints and CPU registers \\nTiming and latency: check the time taken for the execution of instructions \\nDetecting and penalizing debugger<ref name=\"soft-prot\" /><!-- reference does not exist --> \\nAn early example of anti-debugging existed in early versions of Microsoft Word which, if a debugger was detected, produced a message that said: \"The tree of evil bears bitter fruit.

(1997). \"Konrad Zuse\\'s Plankalkül: The First High-Level \"non von Neumann\" Programming Language\". IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, vol. 19, no. 2, pp.&nbsp;17–24,  April–June, 1997. [http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/85.586068 (abstract)] However, it was not implemented in his time, and his original contributions were (due to World War II) largely isolated from other developments, although it influenced Heinz Rutishauser\\'s language \"Superplan\" (and to some degree also Algol). The first really widespread high-level language was Fortran, a machine independent development of IBM\\'s earlier Autocode systems. ALGOL|Algol, defined in 1958 and 1960, by committees of European and American computer scientists, introduced recursion as well as nested functions under lexical scope. It was also the first language with a clear distinction between call by value|value and call by name|name-parameters and their corresponding semantics.Although it lacked a notion of call by reference|reference-parameters, which could be a problem in some situations. Several successors, including AlgolW, Algol68, Simula, Pascal (programming language)|Pascal, Modula and Ada (programming language)|Ada therefore included reference-parameters (The related C-language family instead allowed addresses as \\'\\'\\'value\\'\\'\\'-parameters). Algol also introduced several structured programming concepts, such as the \\'\\'\\'while-do\\'\\'\\' and \\'\\'\\'if-then-else\\'\\'\\' constructs and its syntax was the first to be described by a formal method, Backus–Naur form (BNF). During roughly the same period Cobol introduced record (computer science)|records (also called structs) and Lisp (programming language)|Lisp introduced a fully general lambda abstraction in a programming language for the first time. \\n== Features == \\n\"High-level language\" refers to the higher level of abstraction from machine language. Rather than dealing with registers, memory addresses and call stacks, high-level languages deal with variables, arrays, object (computer science)|objects, complex arithmetic or boolean expressions, subroutines and functions, loops, Thread (computer science)|threads, locks, and other abstract computer science concepts, with a focus on usability over optimal program efficiency. Unlike low-level assembly languages, high-level languages have few, if any, language elements that translate directly into a machine\\'s native opcodes. Other features, such as string handling routines, object-oriented language features, and file input/output, may also be present. \\n== Abstraction penalty == \\nHigh-level languages intend to provide features which standardize common tasks, permit rich debugging, and maintain architectural agnosticism; while low-level languages often produce more efficient code through optimization for a specific system architecture. \\'\\'Abstraction penalty\\'\\' is the border that prevents high-level programming techniques from being applied in situations where computational limitations, standards conformance or physical constraints require access to low-level architectural resources (fi, response time(s), hardware integration). High-level programming exhibits features like more generic data structures/operations, run-time interpretation, and intermediate code files; which often result in execution of far more operations than necessary, higher memory consumption, and larger binary program size.{{cite journal \\n|author=Surana P \\n|title=Meta-Compilation of Language Abstractions. \\n|year=2006 \\n|url=ftp://lispnyc.org/meeting-assets/2007-02-13_pinku/SuranaThesis.pdf \\n|format=PDF \\n|accessdate=2008-03-17 \\n|deadurl=yes \\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217154926/http://lispnyc.org/meeting-assets/2007-02-13_pinku/SuranaThesis.pdf \\n|archivedate=2015-02-17 \\n|df= \\n}}{{cite web \\n| last = Kuketayev \\n| title = The Data Abstraction Penalty (DAP) Benchmark for Small Objects in Java. \\n| url= http://www.adtmag.com/joop/article.aspx?id=4597 \\n| accessdate = 2008-03-17 }}{{Cite book \\n| last = Chatzigeorgiou \\n| last2 = Stephanides \\n| editor-last = Blieberger \\n| editor2-last = Strohmeier \\n| contribution = Evaluating Performance and Power Of Object-Oriented Vs.

In many cases, critical portions of a program mostly in a high-level language can be hand-coded in assembly language, leading to a much faster, more efficient, or simply reliably functioning Program optimisation|optimised program. \\nHowever, with the growing complexity of modern microprocessor architectures, well-designed compilers for high-level languages frequently produce code comparable in efficiency to what most low-level programmers can produce by hand, and the higher abstraction may allow for more powerful techniques providing better overall results than their low-level counterparts in particular settings. \\n{{Cite journal \\n|author1=Manuel Carro |author2=José F.

This facilitates executing a program written in such a language on any computing system with compatible support for the Interpreted or Just-in-time compilation|JIT program. High-level languages can be improved as their designers develop improvements. In other cases, new high-level languages evolve from one or more others with the goal of aggregating the most popular constructs with new or improved features. An example of this is Scala (programming language)|Scala which maintains backward compatibility with Java (programming language)|Java which means that programs and libraries written in Java will continue to be usable even if a programming shop switches to Scala; this makes the transition easier and the lifespan of such high-level coding indefinite. In contrast, low-level programs rarely survive beyond the system architecture which they were written for without major revision. This is the engineering \\'trade-off\\' for the \\'Abstraction Penalty\\'. \\n== Relative meaning == \\nExamples of high-level programming languages in active use today include Python (programming language)|Python, Visual Basic, Delphi (programming language)|Delphi, Perl, PHP, ECMAScript, Ruby (programming language)|Ruby and many others. \\nThe terms \\'\\'high-level\\'\\' and \\'\\'low-level\\'\\' are inherently relative. Some decades ago, the C (programming language)|C language, and similar languages, were most often considered \"high-level\", as it supported concepts such as expression evaluation, parameterised recursive functions, and data types and structures, while assembly language was considered \"low-level\".  Today, many programmers might refer to C as low-level, as it lacks a large Run time system|runtime-system (no garbage collection, etc.), basically supports only scalar operations, and provides direct memory addressing. It, therefore, readily blends with assembly language and the machine level of CPUs and microcontrollers. \\nAssembly language may itself be regarded as a higher level (but often still one-to-one if used without Macro (computer science)|macros) representation of machine code, as it supports concepts such as constants and (limited) expressions, sometimes even variables, procedures, and data structures. Machine code, in its turn, is inherently at a slightly higher level than the microcode or micro-operations used internally in many processors. \\n== Execution modes == \\nThere are three general modes of execution for modern high-level languages: \\n; Interpreted : When code written in a language is interpreted language|interpreted, its syntax is read and then executed directly, with no compilation stage. A program called an \\'\\'interpreter\\'\\' reads each program statement, following the program flow, then decides what to do, and does it. A hybrid of an interpreter and a compiler will compile the statement into machine code and execute that; the machine code is then discarded, to be interpreted anew if the line is executed again. Interpreters are commonly the simplest implementations of the behavior of a language, compared to the other two variants listed here. \\n; Compiled : When code written in a language is Compiled language|compiled, its syntax is transformed into an executable form before running. There are two types of compilation: \\n:; Machine code generation : Some compilers compile source code directly into machine code. This is the original mode of compilation, and languages that are directly and completely transformed to machine-native code in this way may be called \"truly compiled\" languages. See assembly language. \\n:; Intermediate representations : When code written in a language is compiled to an intermediate representation, that representation can be optimized or saved for later execution without the need to re-read the source file. When the intermediate representation is saved, it may be in a form such as byte code. The intermediate representation must then be interpreted or further compiled to execute it. Virtual machines that execute byte code directly or transform it further into machine code have blurred the once clear distinction between intermediate representations and truly compiled languages. \\n; Source-to-Source Translated or Trans-compiled: Code written in a language may be translated into terms of a lower-level programming language for which native code compilers are already widely available. JavaScript and the C (programming language)|C programming language are common targets for such translators. See CoffeeScript, Chicken Scheme, and Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel as examples. Specifically, the generated C and C++ code can be seen (as generated from the Eiffel programming language when using the EiffelStudio IDE) in the EIFGENs directory of any compiled Eiffel project. In Eiffel, the \"Translated\" process is referred to as Trans-compiling or Trans-compiled, and the Eiffel compiler as a Source-to-source compiler|Transcompiler. \\nNote that languages are not strictly \"interpreted\" languages or \"compiled\" languages. Rather, implementations of language behavior use interpretation or compilation. For example, Algol 60 and Fortran have both been interpreted (even though they were more typically compiled). Similarly, Java shows the difficulty of trying to apply these labels to languages, rather than to implementations; Java is compiled to bytecode and the bytecode is subsequently executed by either interpretation (in a Java Virtual Machine|JVM) or compilation (typically with a just-in-time compiler such as HotSpot, again in a JVM). Moreover, compilation, trans-compiling, and interpretation are not strictly limited to just a description of the compiler artifact (binary executable or IL assembly). \\n===High-level language computer architecture=== \\nAlternatively, it is possible for a high-level language to be directly implemented by a computer – the computer directly executes the HLL code. This is known as a \\'\\'high-level language computer architecture\\'\\' – the computer architecture itself is designed to be targeted by a specific high-level language. \\n== See also == \\n{{Portal|Computer programming}} \\nAbstraction (computer science) \\nGenerational list of programming languages \\nLow-level programming languages \\nHigh-level assembler \\nVery high-level programming languages \\nCategorical list of programming languages \\n{{Clear}} \\n== References == \\n{{Reflist}} \\n== External links == \\nhttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HighLevelLanguage - The WikiWikiWeb\\'s article on high-level programming languages \\n{{Programming language}} \\n{{Authority control}} \\n{{DEFAULTSORT:High-Level Programming Language}} \\nCategory:Programming language classification',\n"," '{{Selfref|To report a MediaWiki error on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Bug reports.}} \\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2015}} \\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2012}} \\n{{software development process}} \\nA \\'\\'\\'software bug\\'\\'\\' is an error, flaw, failure or fault (technology)|fault in a computer program or software system|system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

A few are caused by compilers producing incorrect code. A program that contains a large number of bugs, and/or bugs that seriously interfere with its functionality, is said to be \\'\\'buggy\\'\\' (defective). \\nBugs trigger errors that may have ripple effects.

Various innovations in programming style and defensive programming are designed to make these bugs less likely, or easier to spot. Some typos, especially of symbols or logical/Operator (mathematics)|mathematical operators, allow the program to operate incorrectly, while others such as a missing symbol or misspelled name may prevent the program from operating. Compiled languages can reveal some typos when the source code is compiled. \\n= Development methodologies = \\nSeveral schemes assist managing programmer activity so that fewer bugs are produced. Software engineering (which addresses software design issues as well) applies many techniques to prevent defects. For example, formal program specifications state the exact behavior of programs so that design bugs may be eliminated. Unfortunately, formal specifications are impractical for anything but the shortest programs, because of problems of combinatorial explosion and Nondeterministic algorithm|indeterminacy. \\nUnit testing involves writing a test for every function (unit) that a program is to perform. \\nIn test-driven development unit tests are written before the code and the code is not considered complete until all tests complete successfully. \\nAgile software development involves frequent software releases with relatively small changes. Defects are revealed by user feedback. \\nOpen source development allows anyone to examine source code. A school of thought popularized by Eric S. Raymond as Linus\\'s Law says that popular open-source software has more chance of having few or no bugs than other software, because \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\".[http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html \"Release Early, Release Often\"], Eric S. Raymond, \\'\\'The Cathedral and the Bazaar\\'\\' This assertion has been disputed, however: computer security specialist Elias Levy wrote that \"it is easy to hide vulnerabilities in complex, little understood and undocumented source code,\" because, \"even if people are reviewing the code, that doesn\\'t mean they\\'re qualified to do so.\"[http://www.securityfocus.com/news/19 \"Wide Open Source\"], Elias Levy, \\'\\'SecurityFocus\\'\\', April 17, 2000 An example of this actually happening, accidentally, was the Debian#2008 OpenSSL vulnerability|2008 OpenSSL vulnerability in Debian. \\n= Programming language support = \\nProgramming languages include features to help prevent bugs, such as static type systems, restricted namespaces and modular programming. For example, when a programmer writes (pseudocode) <code>LET REAL_VALUE PI = \"THREE AND A BIT\"</code>, although this may be syntactically correct, the code fails a Type checking|type check. Compiled languages catch this without having to run the program. Interpreted languages catch such errors at runtime. Some languages deliberate exclude features that easily lead to bugs, at the expense of slower performance: the general principle being that, it is almost always better to write simpler, slower code than inscrutable code that runs slightly faster, especially considering that maintenance cost is substantial. For example, the Java (programming language)|Java programming language does not support pointer (computer programming)|pointer arithmetic; implementations of some languages such as Pascal (programming language)|Pascal and scripting languages often have runtime bounds checking of arrays, at least in a debugging build. \\n= Code analysis = \\nTools for Static code analysis|code analysis help developers by inspecting the program text beyond the compiler\\'s capabilities to spot potential problems. Although in general the problem of finding all programming errors given a specification is not solvable (see halting problem), these tools exploit the fact that human programmers tend to make certain kinds of simple mistakes often when writing software. \\n= Instrumentation = \\nTools to monitor the performance of the software as it is running, either specifically to find problems such as Bottleneck (engineering)|bottlenecks or to give assurance as to correct working, may be embedded in the code explicitly (perhaps as simple as a statement saying <code>PRINT \"I AM HERE\"</code>), or provided as tools. It is often a surprise to find where most of the time is taken by a piece of code, and this removal of assumptions might cause the code to be rewritten. \\nTesting \\nSoftware testers are professionals whose primary task is to find bugs, or write code to support testing.  On some projects, more resources may be spent on testing than in developing the program. \\nMeasurements during testing can provide an estimate of the number of likely bugs remaining; this becomes more reliable the longer a product is tested and developed.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} \\nDebugging \\nFile:Classpath bugs.png|thumb|350px|The typical bug history (GNU Classpath project data). A new bug submitted by the user is \\'\\'unconfirmed.\\'\\' Once it has been reproduced by a developer, it is a \\'\\'confirmed\\'\\' bug. The confirmed bugs are later \\'\\'fixed\\'\\'. Bugs belonging to other categories (unreproducible, will not be fixed, etc.) are usually in the minority \\n{{Main article|Debugging}} \\nFinding and fixing bugs, or \\'\\'debugging\\'\\', is a major part of computer programming. Maurice Wilkes, an early computing pioneer, described his realization in the late 1940s that much of the rest of his life would be spent finding mistakes in his own programs.q:Maurice Wilkes|Maurice Wilkes Quotes \\nUsually, the most difficult part of debugging is finding the bug. Once it is found, correcting it is usually relatively easy. Programs known as debuggers help programmers locate bugs by executing code line by line, watching variable values, and other features to observe program behavior. Without a debugger, code may be added so that messages or values may be written to a console or to a window or log file to trace program execution or show values. \\nHowever, even with the aid of a debugger, locating bugs is something of an art. It is not uncommon for a bug in one section of a program to cause failures in a completely different section,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} thus making it especially difficult to track (for example, an error in a graphics Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering routine causing a file Input/output|I/O routine to fail), in an apparently unrelated part of the system. \\nSometimes, a bug is not an isolated flaw, but represents an error of thinking or planning on the part of the programmer. Such \\'\\'logic errors\\'\\' require a section of the program to be overhauled or rewritten. As a part of code review, stepping through the code and imagining or transcribing the execution process may often find errors without ever reproducing the bug as such. \\nMore typically, the first step in locating a bug is to reproduce it reliably. Once the bug is reproducible, the programmer may use a debugger or other tool while reproducing the error to find the point at which the program went astray. \\nSome bugs are revealed by inputs that may be difficult for the programmer to re-create.  One cause of the Therac-25 radiation machine deaths was a bug (specifically, a race condition) that occurred only when the machine operator very rapidly entered a treatment plan; it took days of practice to become able to do this, so the bug did not manifest in testing or when the manufacturer attempted to duplicate it.  Other bugs may disappear when the program is run with a debugger; these heisenbug|\\'\\'heisenbugs\\'\\' (humorously named after the uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle). \\nSince the 1990s, particularly following the Ariane 5 Flight 501 disaster, interest in automated aids to debugging rose, such as static code analysis by abstract interpretation.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} \\nSome classes of bugs have nothing to do with the code. Faulty documentation or hardware may lead to problems in system use, even though the code matches the documentation. In some cases, changes to the code eliminate the problem even though the code then no longer matches the documentation. Embedded systems frequently workaround|work around hardware bugs, since to make a new version of a Read-only memory|ROM is much cheaper than remanufacturing the hardware, especially if they are commodity items. \\nBug management \\nBug management includes the process of documenting, categorizing, assigning, reproducing, correcting and releasing the corrected code. Proposed changes to software&nbsp;– bugs as well as enhancement requests and even entire releases&nbsp;– are commonly tracked and managed using bug tracking systems or issue tracking systems. The items added may be called defects, tickets, issues, or, following the agile development paradigm, stories and epics. Categories may be objective, subjective or a combination, such as version number, area of the software, severity and priority, as well as what type of issue it is, such as a feature request or a bug. \\n= Severity = \\n\\'\\'Severity\\'\\' is the impact the bug has on system operation. This impact may be data loss, financial, loss of goodwill and wasted effort. Severity levels are not standardized. Impacts differ across industry. A crash in a video game has a totally different impact than a crash in a web browser, or real time monitoring system. For example, bug severity levels might be \"crash or hang\", \"no workaround\" (meaning there is no way the customer can accomplish a given task), \"has workaround\" (meaning the user can still accomplish the task), \"visual defect\" (for example, a missing image or displaced button or form element), or \"documentation error\". Some software publishers use more qualified severities such as \"critical\", \"high\", \"low\", \"blocker\" or \"trivial\".{{cite web|url=http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.4/en/html/bug_page.html|title=5.3. Anatomy of a Bug|work=bugzilla.org}} The severity of a bug may be a separate category to its priority for fixing, and the two may be quantified and managed separately. \\n= Priority = \\n\\'\\'Priority\\'\\' controls where a bug falls on the list of planned changes. The priority is decided by each software producer. Priorities are sometimes numerical and sometimes named, such as \"critical,\" \"high,\" \"low\" or \"deferred\"; note that these may be similar or even identical to severity ratings when looking at different software producers. For example, priority 1 bugs may always be fixed for the next release, while \"5\" bugs may never be fixed. Industry practice employs an inverted scale, so that highest priority are low numbers (0 and 1), while larger numbers indicate lower priority. \\n= Relationship between priority and severity = \\nSevere bugs may still not be of high priority. For example, a crash (high severity) that happens only rarely may be low priority. Priority is a strictly increasing function of probability of occurrence and severity. Given probability p = 1, the severity defines the priority. When p = 0, severity is irrelevant. Low severity bugs may get low priority regardless of the probability of occurrence. \\nOne formula for defining the relationship is: \\n<math>P(p,s) = B - \\\\lceil kpS  \\\\rceil  </math> \\nwhere p is the probability while S is the severity, k a scaling constant, and to invert the value B is the base.  The Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling function limits the domain of priority to only integers. It also assigns  priority-B to almost never occurring bugs. \\n= Software releases = \\nIt is common practice to release software with known, low-priority bugs. Most big software projects maintain two lists of \"known bugs\" – those known to the software team, and those to be told to users.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The second list informs users about bugs that are not fixed in a specific release and workarounds may be offered. Releases are of different kinds. Bugs of sufficiently high priority may warrant a special release of part of the code containing only modules with those fixes. These are known as \\'\\'Patch (computing)|patches\\'\\'. Most releases include a mixture of behavior changes and multiple bug fixes. Releases that emphasize bug fixes are known as \\'\\'maintenance\\'\\' releases. Releases that emphasize feature additions/changes are known as major releases and often have names to distinguish the new features from the old. \\nReasons that a software publisher opts not to patch or even fix a particular bug include: \\nA deadline must be met and resources are insufficient to fix all bugs by the deadline.{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: Slipstream Release|magazine=Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation|issue=15 |publisher=Imagine Media|date=March 1996|page=41}} \\nThe bug is already fixed in an upcoming release, and it is not of high priority. \\nThe changes required to fix the bug are too costly or affect too many other components, requiring a major testing activity. \\nIt may be suspected, or known, that some users are relying on the existing buggy behavior; a proposed fix may introduce a wiktionary:breaking change|breaking change. \\nThe problem is in an area that will be obsolete with an upcoming release; fixing it is unnecessary. \\nIt\\'s \"not a bug\".  A misunderstanding has arisen between expected and perceived behavior, when such misunderstanding is not due to confusion arising from design flaws, or faulty documentation. \\nTypes \\n{{Cleanup list|section|date=August 2015}} \\n{{Prose|section|date=August 2015}} \\nIn software development projects, a \"mistake\" or \"fault\" may be introduced at any stage. Bugs arise from oversights or misunderstandings made by a software team during specification, design, coding, data entry or documentation. For example, a relatively simple program to alphabetize a list of words, the design might fail to consider what should happen when a word contains a hyphen. Or when converting an abstract design into code, the coder might inadvertently create an off-by-one error and fail to sort the last word in a list. Errors may be as simple as a typing error: a \"<\" where a \">\" was intended. \\nAnother category of bug is called a \\'\\'race condition\\'\\' that may occur when programs have multiple components executing at the same time. If the components interact in a different order than the developer intended, they could interfere with each other and stop the program from completing its tasks. These bugs may be difficult to detect or anticipate, since they may not occur during every execution of a program. \\nConceptual errors are a developer\\'s misunderstanding of what the software must do. The resulting may perform according to the developer\\'s understanding, but not what is really needed. Other types: \\n= Arithmetic  = \\nDivision by zero#In computer arithmetic|Division by zero. \\nArithmetic overflow or Arithmetic underflow|underflow. \\nLoss of arithmetic precision due to rounding or numerical stability|numerically unstable algorithms. \\n= Logic  = \\nInfinite loops and infinite Recursion (computer science)|recursion. \\nOff-by-one error, counting one too many or too few when looping. \\n= Syntax  = \\nUse of the wrong operator, such as performing assignment instead of #Equality|equality test. For example, in some languages <nowiki>x=5</nowiki> will set the value of x to 5 while <nowiki>x5</nowiki> will check whether x is currently 5 or some other number. Interpreted languages allow such code to fail. Compiled languages can catch such errors before testing begins. \\n= Resource  = \\nNull pointer dereference. \\nUsing an uninitialized variable. \\nUsing an otherwise valid instruction on the wrong data type (see packed decimal/binary coded decimal). \\nAccess violations. \\nResource leaks, where a finite system resource (such as memory leak|memory or handle leak|file handles) become exhausted by repeated allocation without release. \\nBuffer overflow, in which a program tries to store data past the end of allocated storage. This may or may not lead to an access violation or storage violation. These bugs may form a Software bug#Security vulnerabilities|security vulnerability. \\nExcessive recursion which&nbsp;— though logically valid&nbsp;— causes stack overflow. \\nUse-after-free error, where a Pointer (computer programming)|pointer is used after the system has freed the memory it references. \\nDouble free error. \\n= Multi-threading  = \\nDeadlock, where task A can\\'t continue until task B finishes, but at the same time, task B can\\'t continue until task A finishes. \\nRace condition, where the computer does not perform tasks in the order the programmer intended. \\nConcurrency errors in critical sections, mutual exclusions and other features of Concurrent programming#Coordinating access to resources|concurrent processing. Time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) is a form of unprotected critical section. \\n= Interfacing  = \\nIncorrect API usage. \\nIncorrect protocol implementation. \\nIncorrect hardware handling. \\nIncorrect assumptions of a particular platform. \\nIncompatible systems. Often a proposed \"new API\" or new communications protocol may seem to work when both computers use the old version or both computers use the new version, but upgrading only the receiver exposes backward compatibility problems; in other cases upgrading only the transmitter exposes forward compatibility problems.

In applications such as Human spaceflight|manned space travel or automotive safety, since software flaws have the potential to cause human injury or even death, such software will have far more scrutiny and quality control than, for example, an online shopping website. In applications such as banking, where software flaws have the potential to cause serious financial damage to a bank or its customers, quality control is also more important than, say, a photo editing application.  NASA\\'s Software Assurance Technology Center managed to reduce the number of errors to fewer than 0.1 per 1000 lines of code (Source lines of code|SLOC){{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} but this was not felt to be feasible for projects in the business world. \\nWell-known bugs \\n{{Main article|List of software bugs}} \\nA number of software bugs have become well-known, usually due to their severity: examples include various space and military aircraft crashes. Possibly the most famous bug is the Year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K bug, in which it was feared that worldwide economic collapse would happen at the start of the year 2000 as a result of computers thinking it was 1900. (In the end, no major problems occurred.) \\nThe Knight Capital Group#2012 stock trading disruption|2012 stock trading disruption involved one such incompatibility between the old API and a new API. \\nIn popular culture \\nIn Robert A. Heinlein\\'s 1966 novel \\'\\'The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\\'\\', computer technician Manuel Davis blames a real bug for a (non-existent) failure of supercomputer Mike, presenting a dead fly as evidence. \\nIn the 1968 novel \\'\\'2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey\\'\\' (and its 2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|corresponding 1968 film adaptation), a spaceship\\'s onboard computer, HAL 9000, attempts to kill all its crew members. In the followup 1982 novel, \\'\\'2010: Odyssey Two\\'\\', and the accompanying 1984 film, \\'\\'2010 (film)|2010\\'\\', it is revealed that this action was caused by the computer having been programmed with two conflicting objectives: to fully disclose all its information, and to keep the true purpose of the flight secret from the crew; this conflict caused HAL to become paranoid and eventually homicidal. \\nIn the 1999 American comedy Office Space, the plot focuses on an attempt by three employees to exploit the company\\'s preoccupation with fixing the Y2K computer bug by infecting the company\\'s computer system with a virus that sends rounded off pennies to a separate bank account.  The plan backfires as the virus itself has its own bug which sends large amounts of money to the account prematurely. \\nIn 2000, Joe Trela correctly answered \\'\\'moth\\'\\' for the million dollar question: \"What insect shorted out an early supercomputer and inspired the term Computer Bug.\" in the United States version of the game show \\'\\'Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\'\\'. \\nThe 2004 novel \\'\\'The Bug\\'\\', by Ellen Ullman, is about a programmer\\'s attempt to find an elusive bug in a database application.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} \\nThe 2008 Canadian film \\'\\'Control Alt Delete (film)|Control Alt Delete\\'\\' is about a computer programmer at the end of 1999 struggling to fix bugs at his company related to the year 2000 problem. \\nSee also \\n{{Too many see alsos|date=August 2015}} \\n{{Portal|Software Testing}} \\nAnti-pattern \\nSoftware rot \\nBug bounty program \\nGlitch removal \\nISO/IEC 9126, which classifies a bug as either a \\'\\'defect\\'\\' or a \\'\\'nonconformity\\'\\' \\nOrthogonal Defect Classification \\nRacetrack problem \\nRISKS Digest \\nSoftware defect indicator \\nSoftware regression \\nNotes \\n{{Reflist|30em}} \\nFurther reading \\nAllen, Mitch, May/Jun 2002 \"Bug Tracking Basics: A beginner’s guide to reporting and tracking defects\" \\'\\'The Software Testing & Quality Engineering Magazine\\'\\'.

The original bug can be far removed from the source code|code that actually crashed. \\nIn earlier personal computers, attempting to write data to hardware addresses outside of the system's main memory could cause hardware damage. Some crashes are Exploit (computer security)|exploitable and allow a malicious program or hacker to execute arbitrary code execution|arbitrary code allowing for the replication of computer virus|viruses or the acquisition of data which would normally be inaccessible. \\nApplication crashes \\nImage:Computer crash airport.jpg|thumb|A display at Frankfurt Airport running a program under Windows XP that has crashed due to a Segmentation fault|memory read access violation \\nAn Software application|application typically crashes when it performs an operation which is not allowed by the operating system. The operating system then triggers an exception handling|exception or Signal (computing)|signal in the application. Unix applications traditionally responded to the signal by Core dump|dumping core. Most Windows and Unix Graphical user interface|GUI applications respond by displaying a dialogue box (such as the one shown to the right) \\nwith the option to attach a debugger if one is installed. Some applications attempt to recover from the error and continue running instead of exit (system call)|exiting. \\nTypical errors that result in application crashes include: \\nattempting to read or write memory that is not allocated for reading or writing by that application (segmentation fault) or x86 specific (general protection fault) \\nattempting to execute privileged or invalid instructions \\nattempting to perform I/O operations on computer hardware|hardware devices to which it does not have permission to access \\npassing invalid arguments to system calls \\nattempting to access other system resources to which the application does not have permission to access \\nattempting to execute machine instructions with bad arguments (depending on CPU architecture): Division by zero|divide by zero, operations on Denormal number|denorms or NaN values, memory access to Bus error|unaligned addresses, etc. \\nWeb server crashes \\nThe software running the web server behind a website may crash, rendering it inaccessible entirely or providing only an error message instead of normal content. \\nFor example: if a site is using an SQL database (such as MySQL) for a script (such as PHP) and that SQL database server crashes, then PHP will display a connection error. \\nOperating system crashes \\nAn operating system crash commonly occurs when a Exception handling#Exception handling in hardware|hardware exception occurs that cannot be Exception handling|handled. Operating system crashes can also occur when internal Sanity check|sanity-checking logic within the operating system detects that the operating system has lost its internal self-consistency. \\nModern multi-tasking operating systems, such as Windows NT, Linux, and macOS usually remain unharmed when an application program crashes. \\nSecurity implications of crashes \\nMany software bugs which cause crashes are also Exploit (computer security)|exploitable for arbitrary code execution and other types of privilege escalation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163311.aspx |title=Analyze Crashes to Find Security Vulnerabilities in Your Apps |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date=2007-04-26 |accessdate=2014-06-26}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squarefree.com/2006/11/01/memory-safety-bugs-in-c-code/ |title=Jesse \\nRuderman » Memory safety bugs in C++ code |publisher=Squarefree.com |date=2006-11-01 |accessdate=2014-06-26}} For example, a stack buffer overflow can overwrite the return address of a subroutine with an invalid value, which will cause a segmentation fault when the subroutine returns. However, if an exploit overwrites the return address with a valid value, the code in that address will be executed. \\nSee also \\nBlue Screen of Death \\nCrash-only software \\nCrash reporter

company Uber brings into very sharp focus the question of whether corporations can be said to have a moral character. If any human being were to behave with the single-minded and ruthless greed of the company, we would consider them sociopathic. Uber wanted to know as much as possible about the people who use its service, and those who don’t. It has an arrangement with unroll.me, a company which offered a free service for unsubscribing from junk mail, to buy the contacts unroll.me customers had had with rival taxi companies. Even if their email was notionally anonymised, this use of it was not something the users had bargained for. Beyond that, it keeps track of the phones that have been used to summon its services even after the original owner has sold them, attempting this with Apple’s phones even thought it is forbidden by the company. \\nUber has also tweaked its software so that regulatory agencies that the company regarded as hostile would, when they tried to hire a driver, be given false reports about the location of its cars. Uber management booked and then cancelled rides with a rival taxi-hailing company which took their vehicles out of circulation. Uber deny this was the intention. The punishment for this behaviour was negligible. Uber promised not to use this “greyball” software against law enforcement – one wonders what would happen to someone carrying a knife who promised never to stab a policeman with it. Travis Kalanick of Uber got a personal dressing down from Tim Cook, who runs Apple, but the company did not prohibit the use of the app. Too much money was at stake for that. \\nMillions of people around the world value the cheapness and convenience of Uber’s rides too much to care about the lack of drivers’ rights or pay. Many of the users themselves are not much richer than the drivers. The “sharing economy” encourages the insecure and exploited to exploit others equally insecure to the profit of a tiny clique of billionaires. Silicon Valley’s culture seems hostile to humane and democratic values. The outgoing CEO of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, who is widely judged to have been a failure, is likely to get a $186m payout.

taxi-hailing company Uber brings into very sharp focus the question of whether corporations can be said to have a moral character. If any human being were to behave with the single-minded and ruthless greed of the company, we would consider them sociopathic. Uber wanted to know as much as possible about the people who use its service, and those who don’t. It has an arrangement with unroll.me, a company which offered a free service for unsubscribing from junk mail, to buy the contacts unroll.me customers had had with rival taxi companies. Even if their email was notionally anonymised, this use of it was not something the users had bargained for. Beyond that, it keeps track of the phones that have been used to summon its services even after the original owner has sold them, attempting this with Apple’s phones even thought it is forbidden by the company. \\nUber has also tweaked its software so that regulatory agencies that the company regarded as hostile would, when they tried to hire a driver, be given false reports about the location of its cars. Uber management booked and then cancelled rides with a rival taxi-hailing company which took their vehicles out of circulation. Uber deny this was the intention. The punishment for this behaviour was negligible. Uber promised not to use this “greyball” software against law enforcement – one wonders what would happen to someone carrying a knife who promised never to stab a policeman with it. Travis Kalanick of Uber got a personal dressing down from Tim Cook, who runs Apple, but the company did not prohibit the use of the app. Too much money was at stake for that. \\nMillions of people around the world value the cheapness and convenience of Uber’s rides too much to care about the lack of drivers’ rights or pay. Many of the users themselves are not much richer than the drivers. The “sharing economy” encourages the insecure and exploited to exploit others equally insecure to the profit of a tiny clique of billionaires. Silicon Valley’s culture seems hostile to humane and democratic values. The outgoing CEO of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, who is widely judged to have been a failure, is likely to get a $186m payout. This may not be a cause for panic, any more than the previous hero worship should have been a cause for euphoria.

L’usage morbide, par certains, de Facebook Live a amené son fondateur à annoncer précipitamment le recrutement de 3 000 modérateurs supplémentaires. Il est vrai que l’intelligence artificielle (IA) est bien en peine de reconnaître des contenus violents, surtout diffusés en direct. \\nLe quotidien affreux de ces modérateurs, contraints de visionner des horreurs à longueur de journée, mériterait pourtant qu’on les remplace vite par des machines ! \\nL’IA ne peut pas tout, mais là où elle peut beaucoup, on la maudit, accusée de détruire nos emplois, de remplacer la convivialité humaine. Ce débat repose sur un malentendu. \\nIl vient d’une définition de l’IA qui n’a, dans la réalité, jamais pu être mise en pratique : en 1955, elle était vue comme la création de programmes informatiques qui, quoi qu’on leur confie, le feraient un jour mieux que les humains. On pensait que toute caractéristique de l’intelligence humaine pourrait un jour être si précisément décrite qu’il suffirait d’une machine pour la simuler. Ce n’est pas vrai. \\nAngoisses infondées \\nComme le dit un récent Livre blanc sur la question (Pourquoi il ne faut pas avoir peur de l’Intelligence arti\\xadficielle, Julien Maldonato, Deloitte, mars 2017), rien ne pourra remplacer un humain dans sa globalité. \\nL’IA, c’est de l’apprentissage automatique doté d’un processus d’ajustement de modèles statistiques à des masses de données, explique l’auteur. Il s’agit d’un apprentissage sur des paramètres pour lesquels une vision humaine n’explique pas pourquoi ils marchent si bien dans un contexte donné. \\nC’est aussi ce que dit le rapport de l’Office parlementaire d’évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques (« Pour une intelligence artificielle maîtrisée, utile et démystifiée », 29 mars 2017), pour qui ce côté « boîte noire » explique des angoisses infondées. Ethiquement, se fonder sur l’IA pour des tâches critiques sans bien comprendre le comment... Once the network is trained, we can feed in a photo, and we get out the year in which the system guesses it was taken. For example, for the following two photos ChronoNet guesses 1951 (left) and 1971 (right): \\nConvolutional neural networks are very general and very powerful. As an example, consider Ilya Kostrikov and Tobias Weyand’s ChronoNet, a CNN that guesses the year in which a photo was taken. Since public sources can provide large numbers of digitally archived photos taken over the past century with known dates, it’s relatively straightforward to obtain labeled data (dated photos, in this case) with which to train this network. \\nModern, sophisticated machine learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have many millions of parameters, hence need a great deal of training data to avoid overfitting. Obtaining enough labelled data to both train and test a system is often the greatest practical challenge facing a machine learning researcher. \\nEvery machine learning system has parameters — or there is nothing to learn. Simple systems may have only a handful. Increasing the number of parameters can allow a system to learn more complex relationships, making for a more powerful learner and, if the relationships between input and output are complex, a lower error rate. On the other hand, more parameters also allow a system to memorize more of the training data, hence overfit more easily. This means that there is a relationship between the number of parameters and the amount of training data needed. \\nOne technical pitfall to guard against is overfitting . This happens when the machine is able to memorize the right answers to individual training examples without generalizing, meaning learning an underlying pattern that will hold when tested on different data. The simplest way to avoid overfitting is simply to test the performance of the system on a random subset of the labelled data that is “held out”, meaning not used during training. If the system’s performance on this test data is roughly as good as on the training data, then one can feel confident that the system really has learned how to see a general pattern in the data, and hasn’t just memorized the training examples. This is the same as the rationale for giving students a midterm exam with questions they haven’t seen before, rather than just reusing examples that have been worked through in class. \\nThe relationship between the photo and the response is determined by a set of parameters, which are tuned during a learning phase — hence “machine learning”. The most common approach is supervised learning , which involves working through a large number of labelled examples — that is, example images paired with the desired output for each. When the parameters are set to random values, the machine will only get the answer right by pure chance; but even given a random starting point, one can slowly vary one or more parameters and ask, “is this variation better, or worse?” In this way, by playing a game of Marco Polo with parameters, a computer can optimize itself to learn the task. A typical training program involves trying millions, billions, or trillions of parameter choices, all the while steadily improving performance on the task. Eventually the improvement levels off, telling us that the accuracy has probably gotten as good as it’s going to get, given the inherent difficulty of the task and the limitations of the machine and the data. \\nComputers can analyze the physical features of a person by making calculations based on their picture. This is an example of the more general problem of image understanding: a computer program analyzes a photo, makes a determination about the photo, then emits some kind of meaningful judgement (say, “the person in this photo is likely between the ages of 18 and 23”). \\nWe will begin by reviewing how the underlying machine learning technology works, then turn to a discussion of how machine learning can perpetuate human biases. \\nIn an era of pervasive cameras and big data, machine-learned physiognomy can also be applied at unprecedented scale. Given society’s increasing reliance on machine learning for the automation of routine cognitive tasks, it is urgent that developers, critics, and users of artificial intelligence understand both the limits of the technology and the history of physiognomy, a set of practices and beliefs now being dressed in modern clothes. Hence, we are writing both in depth and for a wide audience: not only for researchers, engineers, journalists, and policymakers, but for anyone concerned about making sure AI technologies are a force for good. \\nMany of us in the research community found Wu and Zhang’s analysis deeply problematic, both ethically and scientifically. In one sense, it’s nothing new. However, the use of modern machine learning (which is both powerful and, to many, mysterious) can lend these old claims new credibility. \\nA recent case in point is Xiaolin Wu and Xi Zhang’s paper , “Automated Inference on Criminality Using Face Images”, submitted to arXiv (a popular online repository for physics and machine learning researchers) in November 2016. Wu and Zhang’s claim is that machine learning techniques can predict the likelihood that a person is a convicted criminal with nearly 90% accuracy using nothing but a driver’s license-style face photo. Although the paper was not peer-reviewed, its provocative findings generated a range of press coverage. [2] \\nRapid developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled scientific racism to enter a new era, in which machine-learned models embed biases present in the human behavior used for model development. Whether intentional or not, this “laundering” of human prejudice through computer algorithms can make those biases appear to be justified objectively. \\nThe practice of using people’s outer appearance to infer inner character is called physiognomy. While today it is understood to be pseudoscience , the folk belief that there are inferior “types” of people, identifiable by their facial features and body measurements, has at various times been codified into country-wide law, providing a basis to acquire land, block immigration, justify slavery, and permit genocide. When put into practice, the pseudoscience of physiognomy becomes the pseudoscience of scientific racism . \\nUsing precise measurements, Lombroso recorded further physical traits he found indicative of derangement, including an “asymmetric face”. Criminals, Lombroso wrote, were “born criminals”. He held that criminality is inherited, and carries with it inherited physical characteristics that can be measured with instruments like calipers and craniographs [1]. This belief conveniently justified his a priori assumption that southern Italians were racially inferior to northern Italians. \\nVillella’s death led to the birth of modern criminology. Nearby lived a scientist and surgeon named Cesare Lombroso, who believed that brigantes were a primitive type of people, prone to crime. Examining Villella’s remains, Lombroso found “evidence” confirming his belief: a depression on the occiput of the skull reminiscent of the skulls of “savages and apes”. \\nIn 1844, a laborer from a small town in southern Italy was put on trial for stealing “five ricottas, a hard cheese, two loaves of bread […] and two kid goats”. The laborer, Giuseppe Villella, was reportedly convicted of being a brigante (bandit), at a time when brigandage — banditry and state insurrection — was seen as endemic . Villella died in prison in Pavia, northern Italy, in 1864. \\nThese are good guesses. The photo on the left was taken on the Stockholm waterfront in 1950, and the one on the right is of Mrs. Nixon in a 1972 campaign motorcade in Atlanta. \\nHow does the network actually figure it out? From a mechanistic point of view, the millions of learned parameters are just the weights used in a series of weighted average calculations. Starting from the original pixel values, weighted averages are combined, then used as input for a similar set of calculations, which are then used as input for a similar set of calculations, and so on — creating a cascade of weighted average calculations in many layers. [3] In ChronoNet, the final layer outputs values corresponding to probabilities for possible years. While technically correct, this “explanation” is of course no explanation at all; a human expert in dating photographs could equally well say “I answered this way because it’s the way my neurons are wired together”. \\nIn fact, like a human expert, the artificial neural network has likely learned to be sensitive to a variety of cues, from low-level properties like the film grain and color gamut (as film processing evolved quite a bit during the 20th century) to clothes and hairstyles, car models and fonts. The loudspeaker and the style of pram in the Stockholm photo might also be clues. The remarkable thing about so-called deep learning, which has powered rapid advances in AI since 2006, is that the features relevant to the task (colors, car models, and so on) can be learned implicitly in the service of a higher-level goal (guessing the year). [4] \\nPrevious approaches to machine learning might also have achieved the high-level goal of guessing the year, but would have needed manually written computer code to extract features like fonts and hairstyles from the raw image. Being able to ask a computer to learn a complex problem from end to end, without such custom work, both greatly speeds development and often dramatically improves the result. \\nThis is both the power and the peril of machine learning, and especially deep learning. The power is clear: a general approach can discover implicit relationships in a wide variety of different problems; the system itself learns what to look for. The peril comes from the fact that a scientist or engineer can easily design a classification task that the machine can learn to perform well — without understanding what the task is actually measuring, or what patterns the system is actually finding. This is problematic when the “how” or “why” of such a system’s judgments matter, as they certainly would if the judgment purported to be of a person’s character or criminal status. \\nLearning a “criminal type” \\n“Automated Inference on Criminality Using Face Images” aims to do what ChronoNet does, except that instead of arbitrary photographs it operates on images of faces, and instead of guessing a year, Wu and Zhang’s system guesses whether the face belongs to a person with a criminal record or not; thus they claim to “produce evidence for the validity of automated face-induced inference on criminality” for the first time. To understand why this claim is problematic, we need to study the methods and results more closely. \\nMethods and results \\nWu and Zhang begin with a set of 1,856 closely cropped, 80x80 pixel images of Chinese men’s faces from government-issued IDs. The men are all between 18 and 55 years old, lack facial hair, and lack facial scars or other obvious markings. 730 of the images are labeled “criminals”, or more precisely, \\n“[…] 330 are published as wanted suspects by the ministry of public security of China and by the departments of public security for the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, etc.; the others are provided by a city police department in China under a confidentiality agreement. […] Out of the 730 criminals 235 committed violent crimes including murder, rape, assault, kidnap and robbery; the remaining 536 are convicted of non-violent crimes, such as theft, fraud, abuse of trust (corruption), forgery and racketeering.” \\nThe other 1,126 face images are of \\n“non-criminals that are acquired from Internet using the web spider tool; they are from a wide gamut of professions and social status, including waiters, construction workers, taxi and truck drivers, real estate agents, doctors, lawyers and professors; roughly half of the individuals […] have university degrees.” \\nIt is worth re-emphasizing that all of the face images are from government-issued IDs — the “criminal” images are not mugshots. Otherwise what comes next would be unsurprising. \\nWu and Zhang use these labeled examples to do supervised learning. They train the computer to look at a face image and produce a one-bit yes/no answer: did this image come from the “criminals” group or the “non-criminals” group? They try out four different machine learning techniques of varying sophistication, in the sense described earlier — more sophisticated techniques have more parameters and are thus able to learn subtler relationships. One of the less sophisticated techniques involves preprocessing the images with custom code to extract the locations of specific known facial features, like the corners of the eyes and the mouth, then using older methods to learn patterns relating the positions of these facial features. The authors also try a convolutional neural net, AlexNet, based on a widely cited 2012 paper by Google researchers Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton. Its architecture is similar to that of ChronoNet. This CNN, which is both the most modern model and the one with the largest number of parameters, is the strongest performer, achieving a classification accuracy of nearly 90%. Even the older methods, though, have accuracies well above 75%. \\nThis raises several questions, perhaps the first of which is “could this result possibly be real?”. More precisely, \\nAre these numbers believable? What is the machine learning picking up on? How does this relate to criminal behavior and criminal judgment? \\nLikely artifacts \\nTo put into perspective just how extraordinary a 90% accuracy claim is, consider that a well-controlled 2015 paper by computer vision researchers Gil Levi and Tal Hassner find that a convolutional neural net with the same architecture (AlexNet) is only able to guess the gender [5] of a face in a snapshot with 86.8% accuracy. [6] Consider, also, that Wu and Zhang’s claimed “false alarm rate” (meaning, the incorrect assignment of a “non-criminal” to the “criminal” group) for the CNN-based method is just over 6% — comparable to a workplace drug test. \\nThere are likely issues with the analysis making the claimed accuracy unrealistically high. One technical problem is that fewer than 2000 examples are insufficient to train and test a CNN like AlexNet without overfitting. The lower (though still highly significant) accuracy numbers given by the older non-deep learning methods are likely more realistic. \\nOne should also note that the authors cannot reliably infer that their web-mined government ID images are all of “non-criminals”; on the contrary, if we presume that they are a good random sample of the general population, statistically some fraction of them will also have engaged in criminal activity. \\nOn the other hand there may easily be other systematic differences between the “criminal” and “non-criminal” datasets that a judge would presumably not want to consider evidence of guilt or innocence. The “criminals” may tend to be younger, for example, even if both populations only include people between 18 and 55. \\nAlso in this vein, the three sample images of “non-criminals” shown in the paper (see below) all appear to be wearing white-collared shirts while none of the three “criminals” are. Of course with only three examples of each we don’t know if this is representative of the entire dataset. We do know that deep learning techniques are powerful and will pick up on any cues present, just as ChronoNet picks up on subtle details like film grain in addition to differences in image content. Machine learning does not distinguish between correlations that are causally meaningful and ones that are incidental. \\nWhat is the machine learning picking up on? \\nSetting aside technical errors and confounds that may influence the claimed accuracy, there is probably a real correlation between facial appearance as captured in the images and membership in the “criminal” set. What specific features distinguish purportedly “criminal” faces? \\nWu and Zhang are able to use a variety of techniques to explore this in detail. This is especially tractable for the simpler machine learning approaches that involve measuring relationships between standard facial landmarks. They summarize, \\n“[…] the angle θ from nose tip to two mouth corners is on average 19.6% smaller for criminals than for non-criminals and has a larger variance. Also, the upper lip curvature ρ is on average 23.4% larger for criminals than for noncriminals. On the other hand, the distance d between two eye inner corners for criminals is slightly narrower (5.6%) than for non-criminals.” [7] \\nWe may be able to get an intuitive sense of what this looks like by comparing the top row of “criminal” examples with the bottom row of “non-criminal” examples, shown in the paper’s Figure 1: \\nFigure 3. Wu and Zhang’s “criminal” images (top) and “non-criminal” images (bottom). In the top images, the people are frowning. In the bottom, they are not. These types of superficial differences can be picked up by a deep learning system. \\nThese are the only six examples the researchers have made public, and there may be a cherrypicking effect at work in the selection of these particular six, but a quick hallway survey (of both Chinese and Western colleagues) suggests that many people, if forced to choose, also find the three bottom photos less likely to be of criminals. For one, although the authors claim to have controlled for facial expression, the three bottom images do all appear to be smiling slightly, while the top ones appear to be frowning. \\nIf these six images are indeed typical, we suspect that asking a human judge to sort the images in order from smiling to frowning would also do a fairly effective job of segregating purportedly “non-criminal” from “criminal”. We will return to this point. \\nWhat do humans pick up on? \\nIt is worth emphasizing that there is no superhuman magic in this (or any) application of machine learning. While non-experts are only able to date a photo very approximately, most people [8] are exquisitely attuned to faces. We can distinguish hundreds or thousands of acquaintances at a glance and from some distance, register nuances of gaze and expression, and do all of this in well under one tenth of a second. [9] \\nWu and Zhang do not claim that their machine learning techniques are recognizing subtler facial cues than people can discern without any help from computers. On the contrary, they connect their work to a 2011 study published in a psychology journal (Valla et al., The Accuracy of Inferences About Criminality Based on Facial Appearance) that arrives at the same conclusion using human judgment: \\n“[…] participants, given a set of headshots of criminals and non-criminals, were able to reliably distinguish between these two groups, after controlling for the gender, race, age, attractiveness, and emotional displays, as well as any potential clues of picture origin.” \\nWhile Wu and Zhang use ID photos and not mugshots, we should note that in Valla et al.’s paper (despite their claims to have controlled for photographic conditions), the authors compared mugshots of convicted people with pictures of students taken on campus. It is reasonable to assume that mugshots taken in the threatening and humiliating context of arrest look different from pictures taken on a college campus, making the result questionable. \\nWu and Zhang also relate their work to a 2014 paper in Psychological Science (Cogsdill et al., Inferring Character From Faces: A Developmental Study), which was co-authored by one of us. This paper finds that even 3- and 4-year olds can reliably distinguish “nice” from “mean” face images, but critically, there is no claim that these impressions correspond to a person’s character. The paper is about the acquisition of facial stereotypes early in development and is based on work that visualizes these stereotypes. \\nWhat do supposedly “nice” and “mean” faces look like? Research on social perception of faces in the last decade has shown that one’s impression of a face can be reduced to a few basic dimensions, including dominance, attractiveness, and valence. (“Valence” is associated with positive evaluations like “trustworthy” and “sociable”.) Various methods have been developed to visualize the facial stereotypes that map onto these dimensions. In one, participants rate randomly generated synthetic faces on traits like trustworthiness and dominance. Because the faces are generated from a statistical model that varies the relative sizes or positions of different facial features, it’s possible to calculate average features representing a “trustworthy” or “untrustworthy” face; for white males, such faces look like this: \\nFigure 4. Stereotypically “nice” (left) and “mean” (right) faces, according to both children and adults. \\nThe “untrustworthy” face and Wu and Zhang’s “criminal” face (Figure 3) look related. \\nThe fallacy of objectivity \\nWu and Zhang don’t use scare quotes in asserting a relationship between people’s impressions (e.g., “untrustworthy”) and purportedly objective reality (e.g., “criminal”), instead claiming that the kinds of facial features we see on the right imply criminality. This incorrect assertion rests on the presumed objectivity and independence of the inputs, outputs, and the algorithm in between. \\nBecause the algorithm they use is based on a highly general deep learning technique that can learn patterns from any kind of image data — a convolutional neural network — it is reasonable to call it objective, that is, it does not in itself embody biases about facial appearance or criminality. \\nThe input is presumed to be objective because it is a standardized ID photo. The output is presumed to be objective because it is a legal judgment — and independent of the input because justice is presumed to be, in the most literal sense, blind. As the authors put it, \\n“We are the first to study automated face-induced inference on criminality free of any biases of subjective judgments of human observers.” \\nThe claims to objectivity in the inputs and outputs are misleading, as we will see, but what is most troubling about this work is its invocation of two different forms of authority, scientific and legal, to once again resurrect and “prove” the existence of a hierarchy of virtue among “types” of people. Those with more curved upper lips and eyes closer together are of a lower social order, prone to (as Wu and Zhang put it) “a host of abnormal (outlier) personal traits” ultimately leading to a legal diagnosis of “criminality” with high probability. \\nThis language closely echoes that of Cesare Lombroso. Before exploring the likely reasons for correlations between facial appearance inputs and criminal judgment outputs, it’s worth pausing and reviewing the history of such claims. \\nScientific racism \\nPhysiognomy and the theory of “types” [10] \\nThe roots of physiognomy lie in the human propensity to interpret a person’s appearance associatively, metaphorically, and even poetically. This kind of thinking, dating back at least to the ancient Greeks, [11] is evident in the Renaissance polymath Giambattista della Porta’s book De humana physiognomonia, which makes the case visually that a piggish-looking person is piggish: [12] \\nFigure 5. Like man, like swine: From Giambattista della Porta’s De humana physiognomonia (Naples, 1586). \\nTo make such ideas respectable in the Enlightenment, it was necessary to excise the poetry from them and concentrate on more specific physical and behavioral features. In the 1700s, the Swiss theologian Johann Caspar Lavater analyzed character based on the shape and positions of the eyes, brows, mouth, and nose to determine whether a person was, among other characteristics, “deceitful”, “full of malice, “incurably stupid”, or a “madman”. \\nIn this vein, Victorian polymath Francis Galton (1822–1911) tried to empirically characterize “criminal” types by superimposing exposures of convicts on the same photographic plate. Around the same time, Lombroso took physiognomic measurement further with his more “scientific” criminological approach. [13] While Lombroso can be credited as one of the first to attempt to systematically study criminality, he can also be credited as one of the first to use modern science to lend authority to his own stereotypes about lesser “types” of humans. \\nFigure 6. Francis Galton’s attempt to reconstruct an “average criminal face”. \\nScientific rigor tends to weed out incorrect hypotheses given time, peer review, and iteration; but using scientific language and measurement doesn’t prevent a researcher from conducting flawed experiments and drawing wrong conclusions — especially when they confirm preconceptions. Such preconceptions are as old as racism itself. \\nScientific racism from 1850–1950 \\nThe beliefs Lombroso appears to have harbored with respect to “southerners” in Italy suggested a racial hierarchy with political implications, but 19th century American physiognomists had even more compelling reasons to rationalize such a hierarchy: they were slave-owners. Samuel Morton used cranial measurements and ethnological arguments to make a case for white supremacy; as his followers Josiah Nott and George Gliddon quoted in their 1854 tribute Types of Mankind, \\n“Intelligence, activity, ambition, progression, high anatomical development, characterize some races; stupidity, indolence, immobility, savagism, low anatomical development distinguish others. Lofty civilization, in all cases, has been achieved solely by the “Caucasian” group.” \\nDespite this book’s scholarly pretensions and the intervening centuries, its figures (typical of the period) illustrate the same kind of fanciful visual “reasoning” and animal analogies evident in della Porta’s treatise, though in the modern context yet more offensively: \\nFigure 6. The idea that there are inferior types of humans has historically been linked to the scientifically invalid idea that some humans are more like animals than others. From Nott and Gliddon, Types of Mankind, 1854. \\nLater in the 19th century, Darwinian evolutionary theory refuted the argument made in Types of Mankind that the races are so different that they must have been created independently by God. However, by making it clear that humans are in fact animals, and moreover closely related to the other great apes, it provided fertile ground for Morton’s discrete racial hierarchy to be reimagined in shades of grey, differentiating humans who are “more human” (more evolved, physically, intellectually and behaviorally) and “less human” (less evolved, physically closer to the other great apes, less intelligent, and less “civilized”). [14] Darwin wrote in his 1871 book The Descent of Man: \\n“[…] man bears in his bodily structure clear traces of his descent from some lower form; […] [n]or is the difference slight in moral disposition between a barbarian, such as the man described by the old navigator Byron, who dashed his child on the rocks for dropping a basket of sea-urchins, and a Howard or Clarkson; and in intellect, between a savage who does not use any abstract terms, and a Newton or Shakspeare. Differences of this kind between the highest men of the highest races and the lowest savages, are connected by the finest gradations.” \\nUnsurprisingly, Darwin’s apex of humanity is peopled by the physicist Isaac Newton, the playwright William Shakespeare, the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson, and the philanthropist John Howard: all were English, Christian, white, male, and from the educated classes — that is, much like Darwin himself. Darwin’s views were in step with (and, in some ways, more progressive than) those of his peers; more generally, they illustrate homophily, the pervasive cognitive bias causing people to identify with and prefer people similar to themselves. \\nThis combination of homophily, rationalization of a racial hierarchy based on heritable physical and behavioral traits, and a resulting theory of physiognomic “types” survived far into the 20th century. The details of the hierarchy shifted depending on the beliefs and sympathies of the theorizer. For the German evolutionary biologist Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), Jews shared a high place alongside Germans and English people in this hierarchy; [15] but in the Nazi era, such hierarchies were used to cartoon and vilify Jews just as Haeckel and his precursors had done for “Papuans”, “Hottentots”, and other foreigners with whom they had no social ties. For example, the 1938 children’s book Der Giftpilz (The Toadstool), used as a state-sponsored school textbook, cautioned that \\n“Just as it is often difficult to tell a toadstool from an edible mushroom, so too it is often hard to recognize the Jew as a swindler and criminal […] How to tell a Jew: the Jewish nose is bent. It looks like the number six […]”. \\nFigure 7. From Vaught’s Practical Character Reader, 1902, p. 80. \\nFigure 8. Nazi “race scientists” doing institutionalized physiognomy, 1933. \\nScientific racism today \\nDespite the social and scientific progress of the past half-century, scientific racism is less firmly relegated to the past than many of us would have assumed. Present-day American “pickup artist” and white nationalist James Weidmann, for example, has blogged in support of physiognomy: \\n“There’s evidence (re)emerging […] that a person’s looks do say something about his politics, smarts, personality, and even his propensity to crime. Stereotypes don’t materialize out of thin air, and the historical wisdom that one can divine the measure of a man (or a woman) by the cut of his face has empirical support. […] You CAN judge a book by its cover: ugly people are more crime-prone. […] Physiognomy is real. It needs to come back as a legitimate field of scientific inquiry […]”. \\nWhat Wu and Zhang’s paper purports to do is precisely that; and while they do not directly suggest applications for their deep learning-based physiognomy, they are excited about its implications for “social psychology, management science, [and] criminology”. \\nAn Israeli startup, Faception, has already taken the logical next step, though they have not published any details about their methods, sources of training data, or quantitative results: \\n“Faception is first-to-technology and first-to-market with proprietary computer vision and machine learning technology for profiling people and revealing their personality based only on their facial image.” \\nThe Faception team are not shy about promoting applications of their technology, offering specialized engines for recognizing “High IQ”, “White-Collar Offender”, “Pedophile”, and “Terrorist” from a face image. [16] Their main clients are in homeland security and public safety. Faception is betting that once again governments will be keen to “judge a book by its cover”. \\nUnexamined assumptions \\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the present-day researchers whose work on social perception of faces Wu and Zhang cite as an inspiration tend to take a more nuanced view of the phenomena they are studying. On one hand, this work has shown that people can form character impressions such as trustworthiness from facial appearance after seeing a face for less than one tenth of a second and that these impressions predict a range of important social outcomes, ranging from political elections to economic transactions to legal decisions. On the other hand, while we form impressions almost reflexively from facial appearance, this does not imply that these impressions are accurate. The evidence suggests that they are not. \\nFundamentally, the idea that there might be some “criminal type”, and that this is evident on a person’s face, rests on several flawed assumptions: \\nThe appearance of a person’s face is purely a function of innate properties; “Criminality” is an innate property in a certain group of people; Criminal judgment by a legal system reliably determines “criminality” in a way that is unaffected by facial appearance. \\nLet’s examine each assumption in turn. \\nReading character into faces \\nFacial structure is not purely innate, but it is also powerfully shaped by development, [17] environment, and context. A photograph of a person’s face further depends on the setting and conditions during photography. Since all of these additional factors can play important roles in the perception of faces — whether by humans or by machines — they are worth summarizing. \\nDorothea Lange’s famous Depression-era photos, such as her “Migrant Mother” series from 1936, take as their subject the emotional shaping of the human face and body by a difficult environment. They can be seen as portraits of the Dust Bowl itself, as refracted through the faces of those unlucky enough to have lived on the American prairie in the 30s. In each such image, the viewer is invited to ask, “what would this person look like under different circumstances, in another time and place?” Foreheads are weatherbeaten and grim; facial muscles reconfigure the expression around a baseline of anxiety and despair; “upper lip curvatures” are all large. In this sense Lange’s photos can almost be read as a critique of physiognomy in their own right. \\nFigure 9. From Dorothea Lange’s “Migrant Mother” series. The original caption reads: “Destitute peapickers in California; a 32 year old mother of seven children. February 1936.” \\nOf course, Lange’s photos are also artistic statements, and reflect her own vision of the Dust Bowl and its people. We must use caution in assuming that such a portrait can be read as a “pure” representation of its subject. \\nResearch shows that the photographer’s preconceptions and the context in which the photo is taken are as important as the faces themselves; different images of the same person can lead to widely different impressions. It is relatively easy to find a pair of images of two individuals matched with respect to age, race, and gender, such that one of them looks more trustworthy or more attractive, while in a different pair of images of the same people the other looks more trustworthy or more attractive. Consider this example, from a 2011 paper in the journal Cognition by Mike Burton and colleagues: \\nFigure 10. Stimuli in R. Jenkins et al’s 2011 paper Variability in photos of the same face. \\nMost people see the face on the left in the top row as more attractive than the face on the right. Most people also see the face on the left in the bottom row as less attractive than the face on the right. However, the two faces on the left are different images of the same person; so are the two faces on the right. \\nIn a recent informal experiment, Canon Lab Australia invited five professional photographers to spend a few minutes with the same man and “register” his essence. Each photographer was given false information about the person, and this false information led to dramatically different photographs. The “self-made millionaire” is staring into the future, whereas the “ex-inmate” looks withdrawn and skeptical. Standard-issue photos such as those used on government IDs are more uniform and presumably more neutral than the Canon Lab Australia photos, but without a carefully controlled experiment, unaccounted biases relating to the setting and the photographer will show up in the data — as they likely do in the 2011 paper by Valla et al. (The Accuracy of Inferences About Criminality Based on Facial Appearance) comparing criminal mugshots with photos taken on a college campus. \\nOvergeneralizing the “resting face” \\nThe idea that there is a perfect correspondence between a person and their image is a psychological illusion fueled by our experience with familiar faces. We instantly recognize images of familiar people, and this recognition evokes our memories and feelings about them. But there is no equivalent process when we look at images of strangers. Each image generates a different and arbitrary impression. \\nThis is in part because it is very difficult to fully separate emotion — even simple impressions like whether a person is smiling or frowning — from the identity of the face itself. Many impressions generated by so-called emotionally neutral faces can be predicted by the similarity of their “neutral” expressions to emotional expressions. \\nConsider the synthetically generated “trustworthy” and “untrustworthy” faces shown earlier. We can see that trustworthy faces have more positive expressions than untrustworthy faces, and that they are more feminine. That is, impressions of trustworthiness are based on similarity to momentary emotional expressions, which signal behavioral intent, as well as gender stereotypes. In the field of social perception of faces, these impressions of character are understood as an overgeneralization from the here-and-now of the person’s possible intentions to what the person is “like” in general. In other words, social intention can be conveyed by moving the face into different configurations, but different people’s faces also fall into different spots and cover different gamuts of this same space of configurations — thus our socially useful ability to read intention has a tendency to overgeneralize and wrongly project emotion or intention onto certain people. We can speculate that this effect might be especially pronounced in a snapshot, where the viewer is unable to gauge context or see more of the expressive range of the face. \\nEssentialism \\nThis kind of facial overgeneralization is an illustration of essentialism, the (incorrect) idea that people have an immutable core or essence that fully determines both appearance and behavior. These were the beliefs of Lavater, Lombroso, and Galton — whose life obsession was eugenics. In modern times, genes often play the role of essence, which in earlier periods took on a more philosophical or even mystical character. \\nEssentialism often seems to color human thought. As Stephen Jay Gould put it in his 1981 book The Mismeasure of Man, \\n“The spirit of Plato dies hard. We have been unable to escape the philosophical tradition that what we can see and measure in the world is merely the superficial and imperfect representation of an underlying reality. […] The technique of correlation has been particularly subject to such misuse because it seems to provide a path for inferences about causality (and indeed it does, sometimes — but only sometimes).” \\nEssentialist reasoning is often circular. For example, in 19th century England, women were commonly held to be essentially incapable of abstract mathematical thought. This was used as a rationale for barring them from higher education in mathematics (“what’s the point?”). Of course, without access to higher education, it was exceedingly difficult for Victorian women to break out of this cycle; yet the absence of women doing higher math was the evidence that they could not do it. Even when, against all odds, a woman managed to rise to the top of the heap, as Philippa Fawcett did when she obtained the top score in the prestigious Cambridge Mathematical Tripos exams in 1890, this was regarded as a freak result rather than indicative of a flawed assumption. [18] Although over the past century we have seen many more examples of first-rate female mathematicians, we are still struggling with this kind of confirmation bias and the legacy of gender essentialism in STEM fields. \\nCriminality \\nWe have seen that facial appearance is influenced by both essential (genetically inherited) and non-essential (environmental, situational, and contextual) factors. What about criminality? Are criminals really a “type”? \\nThe “criminal class” \\nLike physiognomy itself, the idea of a “criminal type” or “criminal class” held great currency in the 19th century. Historian and cultural critic Robert Hughes colorfully narrates England’s 80 year experiment in relocating its criminal class to Australia in his book The Fatal Shore. As he describes from the perspective of colonial art, the transported convict was \\n“not so much “brutalized” (in the modern sense: deformed by ill-treatment) as he was “a brute,” whose criminal nature was written on his very skin.” \\nSending England’s criminals to Australia promised to reduce crime in England — though there is no indication that this worked. What it did accomplish was to foster the essentialist anxiety that the “convict stain” in Australia would pass down through generations, resulting in a perpetually criminal and brutal society down under. Yet, \\n“[…] the truly durable legacy of the convict system was not “criminality” but the revulsion from it: the will to be as decent as possible, to sublimate and wipe out the convict stain, even at the cost […] of historical amnesia.” [19] \\nIt perhaps goes without saying that the idea of a “criminal class” was very much bound up in the idea of social class; in practice, the great majority of transported convicts were poor, and many of their crimes — as in any era — were a function of poverty. Probably many of them would not have looked out of place among Dorothea Lange’s hard-bitten Dust Bowl migrants. Yet despite the well-documented horrors of penal life, once freed, many of these ex-convicts and their descendants found themselves in a much improved situation compared to 19th century urban poverty and class oppression back in England. Their “criminality” turned out to be circumstantial, not essential. As Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, the person most responsible for unraveling the Lavater’s “science”, put it, \\n“What do you hope to conclude from the similarity of faces, especially the fixed features, if the same man who has been hanged could, given all of his dispositions, have received laurels rather than the noose in different circumstances? Opportunity does not make thieves alone; it also makes great men.” \\nCan we, then, make any claims at all about what it might mean for someone to be an intrinsically “criminal type”? \\nTestosterone \\nGender is a good place to start: empirically, people charged with violent crimes tend to be male. Higher testosterone level is likely to be a causal factor, both because it appears to increase aggression and appetite for risk, and because it increases physical strength. [20] These findings have even been replicated in a range of non-human animals. \\nWhile testosterone is arguably not strictly “essential” — its blood concentration can vary depending on the situation, and it can be manipulated pharmaceutically — it comes close. There is also evidence that both prenatal testosterone level and responsiveness to testosterone influence aspects of the body plan, including the length ratio of the index and ring finger, as well as some aspects of behavior, again including aggression. This body of work implies that there are developmental variables influencing both body and behavior; modern proponents of physiognomy invariably point to this work in defense of their position. \\nHowever, some perspective regarding these findings is useful. The sorts of correlations described in these papers are far from powerful enough to let appearance stand in for a lab test: \\n“In pairs of either natural or composite faces the face higher in testosterone was chosen as more masculine 53% and 57% of the time respectively. The authors argue that only men with very high or very low levels of testosterone may be visually distinguishable in terms of their masculinity. […] other studies find no links between testosterone and masculinity. A study using almost identical methods […] but with a much larger set of men, found no association between perceived facial masculinity and testosterone levels […] Similarly, Neave, Laing, Fink, and Manning (2003) reported links of perceived facial masculinity with second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), but not with measured baseline testosterone levels; and Ferdenzi, Lemaître, Leongómez, and Roberts (2011) found no association between perceived facial masculinity and 2D:4D ratio.” \\nIn short, studies have shown that body appearance can weakly correlate with behavior in some circumstances — as would, one suspects, many other superficial cues (e.g. white collars on “non-criminals”). But these correlations fall far short of being suitable as proxy variables. \\nDeep learning can do a better job of extracting nuanced information from an image than simple feature measurements like the face width-to-height ratio. But, as we have pointed out, it is not magic. Many of the papers discussed above use double-blind trials with human judges, precisely because humans are very good at face perception tasks. Deep learning can’t extract information that isn’t there, and we should be suspicious of claims that it can reliably extract hidden meaning from images that eludes human judges. \\nThe alternative is that this information does not elude human judges, any more than it eludes most of us when we look at Wu and Zhang’s three “criminal” and three “non-criminal” sample ID photos. \\nJudgment \\nOver the last several years in the US, we have seen increasing attention to the long-running problem of mass incarceration. While the US comprises about 5% of the world’s population, it contains about 25% of the global prison population — 2.4 million people. Those incarcerated are disproportionately poor and of color; in the US, being a black male makes you nearly seven times likelier to be incarcerated than if you were a white male. [21] This would make a race detector for face images a fairly effective predictor of “criminality” in the US, if by this word we mean — as Wu and Zhang do in China — someone who has been convicted by the legal system. \\nAre such convictions fair? Due to the long shadow of slavery and systematic discrimination, a disproportionate number of black people in the US live in difficult economic circumstances, and this in itself is associated with increased criminal conviction, as was the case for England’s white economic underclass in the 19th century. However, the incarceration disparity is far greater than one would expect from this effect alone. \\nMany different lines of evidence suggest that black people are arrested more often, judged guilty more often, and sentenced more harshly than white people who have committed the same crime. For example, the black imprisonment rate for drug offenses is about 5.8 times higher than it is for whites, despite roughly comparable prevalence of drug use. People who are black also serve longer sentences. A recently published large-scale longitudinal study finds that even the poorest white children are less likely to go to prison at some point than all but the wealthiest 10% of black children. Once in prison, black people are treated more harshly by the correctional facility. Direct tests of racial bias among trial judges have been conducted using hypothetical cases, and have demonstrated harsher judgment of (hypothetical) black defendants, especially when the judges harbor high levels of implicit [22] racial bias — which is endemic among judges just as among the general population. \\nIf one controls for race, as Wu and Zhang did in their experiment, [23] do we eliminate these kinds of implicit biases on the part of the judges who establish the experiment’s criminality “ground truth”? \\nA large body of research suggests otherwise. [24] To list a few examples, in 2015 Brian Holtz of Temple University published the results of a series of experiments in which face “trustworthiness” was shown to strongly influence experimental participants’ judgment. Specifically, the participants were asked to decide, after reading an extended vignette, whether a hypothetical CEO’s actions were fair or unfair. While the judgment varied (as one would hope) depending on how fair or unfair the actions described in the vignette were, it also varied depending on whether a “trustworthy” or “untrustworthy” face was used in the CEO’s profile photo. The photos were of faces with high and low “trustworthiness”, per Oosterhof and Todorov’s 2008 paper. In another study, participants played an online investment game with what they believed were real partners represented by “trustworthy” or “untrustworthy” faces. Participants were more likely to invest in “trustworthy” partners even in the presence of reputational information about the past investment behavior of their partners. Yet more chillingly, a recent study found that among prisoners convicted for first degree murder, the unlucky ones with “untrustworthy” faces were disproportionately more likely to be sentenced to death than to life imprisonment. This was also the case for people who were falsely accused and subsequently exonerated. \\nRecall that these are the same kinds of “face trustworthiness” judgments (or prejudices) that are already clearly exhibited by 3- and 4-year olds. This does not reflect some inner intuitive genius we are endowed with for accurately judging character at a glance. [25] In fact, the evidence suggests that in many cases, we will do much better if were to ignore the faces and rely on general knowledge about the world. Moreover, studies in which the trustworthiness of economic behavior was measured show that relying on face judgments can make our decisions not more but less accurate. \\nSo in summary: \\nA machine learned “criminality detector” can pick up on the same things humans pick up on when we look at an image of a face; \\nWhen viewing “criminal” and “non-criminal” face images, what such a detector picks up on is likely related to negative face perceptions; \\nHuman judges who produce criminality “ground truth” data are themselves strongly influenced by this “untrustworthy” look; and \\nThe “untrustworthy” look seems not to be a good predictor of actual untrustworthiness — and is unlikely to be predictive of criminality. \\nThis is unfortunate for someone who happens to have an “untrustworthy” face. It is also unfortunate that, rather than finding an efficient and impartial shortcut to making accurate criminal judgments with a computer (perhaps a misguided goal in any case), what Wu and Zhang’s experiment likely reveals is the inaccuracy and systematic unfairness of many human judgments, including official ones made in a criminal justice context. \\nWe expect that more research will appear in the coming years that has similar biases, oversights, and false claims to scientific objectivity in order to “launder” human prejudice and discrimination. \\nFeedback loops \\n“It sucks to be poor, and it sucks to feel that you somehow deserve to be poor. You start believing that you’re poor because you’re stupid and ugly. And then you start believing that you’re stupid and ugly because you’re Indian. And because you’re Indian you start believing you’re destined to be poor. It’s an ugly circle and there’s nothing you can do about it.” \\n— Sherman Alexie, The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian \\nThere are already many feedback loops in society that create compounding effects for disadvantage. This has been written about extensively in the context of race, disability, and other categories that have historically been associated with identity. \\nIn addition to the psychological weight of internalized negativity that Sherman Alexie points out, there are powerful pragmatic consequences arising from the same biases being applied to a person repeatedly. If something about one’s appearance causes teachers to suspect cheating, schoolmates to avoid sitting at the same lunch table, strangers to avoid striking up conversation, potential employers to refrain from making an offer, and police officers to “stop and frisk” more often, it would be surprising not to find significant long-term consequences. \\nWhat is most alarming about the prospect of Wu and Zhang’s work being used as a tool for police and security applications, as the Faception startup does, is that it “scientifically” legitimizes a correlation that itself emerges from training data with embedded social bias. Wu and Zhang get their own result exactly wrong when they write, \\n“Unlike a human examiner/judge, a computer vision algorithm or classifier has absolutely no subjective baggages, having no emotions, no biases whatsoever due to past experience, race, religion, political doctrine, gender, age, etc., no mental fatigue, no preconditioning of a bad sleep or meal. The automated inference on criminality eliminates the variable of meta-accuracy (the competence of the human judge/examiner) all together.” \\nThis kind of rhetoric advocates for replacing biased human judgment with a machine learning technique that embeds the same bias — and more reliably. Worse, however, it argues that introducing machine learning into an environment where it can augment or scale up human judgment of criminality can help to make things fairer. In fact it will do the opposite, because humans will assume that the machine’s “judgment” is not only consistently fair on average but independent of their personal biases. They will thus read agreement of its conclusions with their intuition as independent corroboration. Over time it will train human judges who use it to gain confidence in their ability to recognize criminality in the same manner. Our existing implicit biases will be legitimized, normalized, and amplified. We can even imagine a runaway effect if subsequent versions of the machine learning algorithm are trained with criminal convictions in which the algorithm itself played a causal role. \\n“Predictive policing” (listed as one of TIME Magazine’s 50 best inventions of 2011) is an early example of such a feedback loop. The idea is to use machine learning to allocate police resources to likely crime spots. Believing in machine learning’s objectivity, several US states implemented this policing approach. However, many noticed that the system was learning from previous data. If police were patrolling black neighborhoods more than white neighborhoods, this would lead to more arrests of black people; the system then learns that arrests are more likely in black neighborhoods, leading to reinforcement of the original human bias. It does not result in optimal policing with respect to actual incidence of crime. \\nConclusion \\nOn a scientific level, machine learning can give us an unprecedented window into nature and human behavior, allowing us to introspect and systematically analyze patterns that used to be in the domain of intuition or folk wisdom. Seen through this lens, Wu and Zhang’s result is consistent with and extends a body of research that reveals some uncomfortable truths about how we tend to judge people. \\nOn a practical level, machine learning technologies will increasingly become a part of all of our lives, and like many powerful tools they can and often will be used for good — including to make judgments based on data faster and fairer. \\nMachine learning can also be misused, often unintentionally. Such misuse tends to arise from an overly narrow focus on the technical problem, hence: \\nLack of insight into sources of bias in the training data; \\nLack of a careful review of existing research in the area, especially outside the field of machine learning; \\nNot considering the various causal relationships that can produce a measured correlation; \\nNot thinking through how the machine learning system might actually be used, and what societal effects that might have in practice. \\nWu and Zhang’s paper illustrates all of the above traps. This is especially unfortunate given that the correlation they measure — assuming that it remains significant under more rigorous treatment — may actually be an important addition to the already significant body of research revealing pervasive bias in criminal judgment. Deep learning based on superficial features is decidedly not a tool that should be deployed to “accelerate” criminal justice; attempts to do so, like Faception’s, will instead perpetuate injustice. \\nThanks \\nCharina Choi, Google \\nJason Friedenfelds, Google \\nTobias Weyand, Google \\nTim Freeman, Google \\nAlison Lentz, Google \\nJac de Haan, Google \\nMeredith Whittaker, Google \\nKathryn Hume, Fast Forward Labs \\nNotes \\n[1] The craniograph, for measuring the silhouette of a skull, was one of a number of instruments developed specifically for such applications. \\n[2] Around the same time, a paper on predicting first impressions from faces using deep learning, which correctly identified that they were measuring subjective impressions — not objective character — received less attention. \\n[3] This layered architecture is loosely modeled on the brain’s visual cortex, with each weight corresponding to the strength of a synapse, or electrochemical connection from one neuron to another. \\n[4] Many convolutional neural networks, including ChronoNet, fall into the category of deep learning. The “deep” means that there are many layers of consecutive operations (hence many parameters). \\n[5] In this paper gender is modeled as binary and ground truth is based on self-declared gender identity. \\n[6] In fairness, the real-world corpus of snapshots analyzed in this paper includes some blurry images, people facing away or wearing large sunglasses, and other difficult cases not found in ID photos. \\n[7] This is reminiscent of the “facial angle” measurement used by Dutch scholar Pieter Camper (1722–89) to “infer” intelligence. \\n[8] There are specific cognitive disorders that impair some people’s performance at this task, just as dyslexia impairs reading. “Face blindness” or prosopagnosia may affect ~2.5% of the population, including some surprising cases like the portrait artist Chuck Close. \\n[9] One of the great achievements of machine learning over the past few years has been to finally — after decades of effort by many research labs — match human acuity in face recognition. \\n[10] This is a link to the first chapter of the new book Face Value: The Irresistible Influence of First Impressions, written by one of us (Todorov), which includes a more thorough review of the history of physiognomy. \\n[11] Similar analogical thinking was behind the “theory of humors”, also Greek in origin, which held that the balance of blood, phlegm, black bile and yellow bile determined both health and personality. A number of English words still in use derive from this theory: sanguine, phlegmatic, bilious, choleric, melancholic. \\n[12] What it might mean for a human personality to be “piggish” is of course a second analogical leap. \\n[13] Neither his methods nor his analysis would pass muster today. His measurements were selective, his datasets small, and his samples biased. \\n[14] In The Descent of Man Darwin wrote of slavery that it was “the great sin”, though in the next breath noted, “Some savages take a horrid pleasure in cruelty to animals, and humanity with them is an unknown virtue.” For Darwin the sin of slavery was thus one of cruelty, not of inequality. \\n[15] Haeckel had Jewish friends and colleagues, and was Germany’s leading popularizer of Darwin, so it is perhaps unsurprising to find both Jewish and English people favored in his racial hierarchy. \\n[16] On their website they also annotate these “types” with pop-psychological descriptions that read very much like typologies in a vintage book on physiognomy, as in their “Bingo Player” description (yes, they have a Bingo Player detector): “Endowed with a high mental ceiling, high concentration, adventurousness, and strong analytical abilities. Tends to be creative, with a high originality and imagination, high conservation and sharp senses.” \\n[17] For example: an identical twin study finds that sun exposure, smoking, and body mass index (determined in large part by food and exercise habits), significantly affect facial aging. \\n[18] “Her score was 13 per cent higher than the second highest score, but she did not receive the title of senior wrangler, as only men were then ranked, with women listed separately.” (Wikipedia.) \\n[19] See The Fatal Shore, Chapter 10, endnote 48. \\n[20] Violent crimes are especially associated with men. In the US, men are convicted of 98% of rape, 90% of murder, and 78% of aggravated assault, but only 57% of larceny-theft and 51% of embezzlement. Canadian data are similar. This suggests that nonviolent or white collar crime may not be strongly gendered. \\n[21] In this statistic “black” and “white” both exclude populations also identifying as Hispanic/Latino. \\n[22] Racial implicit bias is measured using reaction time on a simple classification test (white and black faces together with good and bad words). It reveals positive or negative associations with race, independently of a subject’s conscious beliefs. It is exceedingly common for a person to harbor implicit bias even if that person is not consciously or explicitly racist; in fact, black subjects typically also exhibit implicit anti-black bias. \\n[23] Their subjects are all Chinese men; there may be questions worth asking regarding finer-grained ethnic, economic and educational distinctions between the “criminal” and “non-criminal” sets that are beyond the scope of this analysis. \\n[24] This research, as well as the lack of evidence for the accuracy of first impressions, is also reviewed in Face Value: The Irresistible Influence of First Impressions. \\n[25] Malcolm Gladwell’s book Blink popularized the idea that snap judgments (also referred to as “thin slices”) can be just as accurate as rational consideration. While intuitively appealing, this view has limited validity, as the book itself acknowledges, and has been widely critiqued. Image copyright EPA Image caption Uber has been criticised many times over the way it runs its business \\nRide-sharing firm Uber is facing a criminal investigation by the US government. \\nThe scrutiny has started because the firm is accused of using \"secret\" software that let it operate in regions where it was banned or restricted. \\nThe software, called \"greyball\", helped it identify officials seeking to stop the service running. \\nA spokesman for Uber declined to comment on the investigation, reported the Reuters news agency. \\nIt is claimed greyball was used in several areas, including Portland, Oregon, where the ride service was still seeking official approval to operate. \\nBookings blocked \\nIn those areas, transport regulation officials posed as passengers in a bid to prove that the company was operating illegally. Greyball worked out who the officials were and blocked them from booking rides with the company\\'s drivers. \\nIn a letter sent last week to transport regulators in Portland, Uber said it used the greyball software \"exceedingly sparingly\" in the city and had not used it since April 2015 when it was granted permission to operate. \\nUber\\'s use of the software was revealed by the New York Times earlier this year. Uber defended its use in a blog saying the software helped it work out if a ride request was legitimate. It helped Uber limit fraud and protect drivers from harm, it added. \\nIt is not clear what sanctions Uber will face if the investigation finds that it did act illegally. \\nThe criminal inquiry comes at a difficult time for Uber which has faced criticism on many fronts. It is currently fighting a lawsuit from Google-backed self-driving car firm Waymo.Despite all the current hype about the rise of voice-assisted devices using Alexa and Siri, linguistics researcher Rachael Tatman found people complaining on social media that the technology still doesn’t understand them. \\nThat’s especially true with regional accents of people who live in the South or are from countries like New Zealand, Tatman said last week during a conference in San Francisco. \\n“So this is the whatever the opposite of delight is as a user experience,” she said. “People are so upset that they’re going on Twitter and yelling about it.” \\nTatman, a doctoral candidate with the University of Washington’s linguistics department, was one of the speakers at a two-day Virtual Assistant Summit, which wrapped up Friday at the Park Central Hotel. The conference, and an adjacent Deep Learning Summit, drew about 600 people representing companies that are working on advancing artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics. \\nLots of people are already using those technologies in programs like Apple’s Siri. They are moving beyond mobile phones and into smart-home devices like Amazon’s Echo. Other fast-changing technologies include artificial intelligence and consumer robotics, especially with self-driving cars on the horizon. \\nBut there’s still work to be done in each of those areas, speakers said. For example, artificial speech recognition technologies still fall short of the way humans can quickly learn and discern speech patterns from each other in “as little as two sentences,” Tatman said. \\nBut that’s because humans take into account other factors, such as the gender of person talking or whether they’ve previously met someone from the the same region, she said. \\nTatman examined YouTube’s automatic captioning program, which can translate spoken words into text in several languages. She found that more errors showed up in translations from speakers who had a Southern accent than from people who lived in California. \\n“The South is the largest demographic region in the United States,” she said. “If you’re using a voice-based virtual assistant and you can’t deal with Southern speech, you’re going to have problems reaching this market.” \\nFor businesses trying to serve those markets, speech recognition technology could be crucial to future revenue, said Stephen Scarr, CEO of search services Info.com and eContext. \\nWith 20 percent of all searches already done through voice, “this is really important, this is No. 1 on your radar,” Scarr told the developers. \\nAs an example of the challenge, a recent YouTube video showed Amazon’s Alexa misunderstanding a young boy’s request to play a song, and instead offering to play an audio porn channel. \\nThe conference touched on more than just speech technologies. Alonso Martinez, a Pixar Animation Studios technical director, said robot developers could take cues from the ways animators create deep emotional connections with audiences. \\n“When you’re thinking about a robot, don’t think about it as a generic, faceless thing,” said Martinez, who developed characters in “Up” and “Inside Out,” two of the Emeryville company’s hit movies. “You need to ask what makes them admirable. What are the values that they have that I wish that I had in myself?” \\nElena Corina Grigore of Yale University’s Social Robotics Lab said robots now used in manufacturing can work by themselves because they are easily trained to perform specialized, repetitive tasks. But robots are not well-equipped to collaborate with humans, she said. \\nThat’s slowly changing with advances in artificial intelligence. As an example, Grigore played a video of a robot trained to help a person with what can be a complex and maddening task — assembling a chair from Ikea. \\nStill, Grigore said, “We’re not getting replaced by robots anytime soon. We’re not at a point where the robots have the intelligence or the physical capabilities necessary to perform all of these actions on their own. Anything that is related to common sense or creativity or types of thinking that require on-the-spot flexibility in a dynamic and changing environment is still very hard to achieve for us.” \\nBenny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

(REUTERS/Edgar Su) \\nThe United Nations forecasts that the global population will rise from 7.3 billion to nearly 10 billion by 2050, a big number that often prompts warnings about overpopulation. Some have come from neo-Malthusians, who fear that population growth will outstrip the food supply, leaving a hungry planet. Others appear in the tirades of anti-immigrant populists, invoking the specter of a rising tide of humanity as cause to slam borders shut. Still others inspire a chorus of neo-Luddites, who fear that the “rise of the robots” is rapidly making human workers obsolete, a threat all the more alarming if the human population is exploding. \\nBefore long, though, we’re more likely to treasure robots than to revile them. They may be the one thing that can protect the global economy from the dangers that lie ahead. \\nAn increase of 2.5 billion people may sound catastrophic. But what matters for economic growth is not the number of people but the rate of population growth. Since its peak in the 1960s, that rate has slumped by almost half to just 1 percent, and the U.N. forecast assumes that this slowdown will continue. Women are having fewer children, so fewer people are entering the working ages between 15 and 64, and labor-force growth is poised to decline from Chile to China. At the same time, owing to rapid advances in health care and medicine, people are living longer , and most of the coming global population increase will be among the retirement crowd. These trends are toxic for economic growth, and boosting the number of robots may be the easiest answer for many countries. \\nOne simple way to estimate how fast an economy can grow is by adding working-age population growth and productivity growth: If the number of workers and output per worker are both increasing by 1 percent a year, then economic output should rise by roughly 2 percent. Over the past decade, both sides of that equation have declined dramatically across the world. In the United States, productivity growth has fallen by almost half from its postwar average, but growth in the labor force has slid even faster, dropping by two-thirds to an average pace of 0.5 percent, according to calculations performed for my book. Though many explanations have been offered for the slow recovery from the global financial crisis of 2008, the clearest answer may be aging populations. Something will have to fill the void left by, say, retiring farmers, and particularly at a time of rising hostility to immigrants, it is likely to be farmbots. \\nIt may not be long before economists are worrying about a global shortage of robots. In many industrial countries, from Germany to Japan to South Korea, growth in the working-age population has already peaked, acting as a drag on the economy. Widely overlooked, however, is the fact that the population-growth slowdown is unfolding even faster in the emerging world, according to my research. \\nConsider the turning point that China hit last year. For the first time since records began in the 1950s, its working-age population growth was negative. As a result, China’s labor force is expected to lose 1 million workers each year for the foreseeable future, and it is also aging rapidly. Studies by Evercore ISI, a research firm, show that the elderly share of the population is rising more than twice as fast as it did in the United States and more than four times faster than in France at similar stages of development. Asked by an alarmed dinner companion about the threat robots posed to jobs in China, Nobel economist Daniel Kahneman responded: “You just don’t get it. In China, the robots are going to come just in time.” No wonder Beijing now offers heavy subsidies to companies involved in industrial automation. \\nAnd timing is critical. Those who fear the job-destroying impact of machines say this generation of technology is different because it is coming so fast. If older generations created tools for use by humans, such as sewing machines, the new forms of automation are imbued with artificial intelligence, capable of “machine learning” and of rapidly replacing humans in a broad swath of jobs, from manufacturing to services — even jobs that involve writing about robots. Concern about this disruptive advance has been stirred up by authorities such as Oxford University researchers Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, who predicted in 2013 that nearly half of U.S. jobs would be at risk from automation in the next decade or two. \\nThese alarms have sounded before, however. The Machine Intelligence Research Institute at the University of California at Berkeley has found that today, the average forecast for when artificial intelligence will arrive is about 20 years. But that was also the standard prediction in 1955. And often, humans find a way of working with their automated creations. After the introduction of supermarket scanners, the number of cashiers grew. Though legal-discovery software appeared to threaten the jobs of paralegals, their ranks increased, too. Now, many fear that self-driving trucks will displace millions of American truckers, but they may create more and better jobs for those who service those increasingly complex vehicles. \\nIf automation was displacing human workers as fast as implied in recent books like Martin Ford’s “The Rise of the Robots,” then we should be seeing a negative impact on jobs already. We’re not. Since 2008, economic growth has been weak compared with that in other post-crisis recoveries, but job growth in the major industrial countries has been relatively strong. In the Group of Seven, the world’s top industrial countries, unemployment has fallen faster than expected in the face of weak economic growth, and faster than in any comparable period since at least the 1970s. The Japanese economy is growing at 0.8 percent, yet it is at full employment. According to my research, the job picture has been particularly strong in Germany, Japan and South Korea — the industrial countries that employ the most robots . \\nTrue, robots do represent a new obstacle for some poorer nations, namely those few that do not suffer from population decline. In the postwar era, countries like China escaped poverty by moving a rising young population off the farm and into more productive jobs in factories. Indeed, it was unusual for any country to sustain rapid growth unless the working-age population was increasing faster than 2 percent a year. My analysis shows that, in the 1980s, 17 of the 20 largest emerging economies had a working-age population expanding that fast, according to my research, but now there are only two: Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. And they will have a hard time moving a large segment of their young populations into industrial jobs, given that they now have to compete with robotic manufacturing elsewhere. \\nYet for the rising number of countries facing population decline, the effort to lift the labor force has begun. Starting in the 1980s, led by Singapore, nations from Chile to Australia have offered baby bonuses for women to have more children, but many have found that these bonuses are ineffective in the face of stronger cultural forces, including the desire of many women to pursue a career before having children. Others have tried with some success to boost the workforce directly by raising the retirement age, offering women incentives to join or return to the labor force after having kids, and opening doors to immigrant workers. \\nThe simple math, however, shows that particularly in rapidly aging, conservative societies such as Japan and Germany, none of these groups has the potential to make up for coming declines in the working-age population. Germany decided to admit roughly 1 million refugees in 2015, in part for economic reasons, but the resulting controversy has reduced the flow. Germany would have to admit 1.5 million each year through 2030 to fully offset the economic impact of its aging population. Japan, which on average admits fewer than 70,000 immigrants per year, would have to admit 1 million annually. Given the widespread political backlash against immigration, increases this large are unlikely. \\nSo far, robots are drawing comparatively little populist fire, perhaps in part because their numbers are still quite low. Worldwide, the industrial labor force includes about 320 million humans, compared with just 1.6 million robots. That’s a huge gap, even counting the superior strength and speed of the robots. And most of them fall in the category of unintelligent machines, committed to a single task such as turning a bolt or painting a car door. Nearly half of them work in the auto industry, which is still the largest employer (of humans) in the United States. \\nIn the future, economists may start counting robots the way they now count gains in the working-age population, as a driver of growth. For much of the world, robots will stand alongside immigrants, women and the elderly as a fourth pool of labor. \\nWhether by design or accident, many of the countries with the most rapidly aging populations already have the most robots. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the nations with the highest density of industrial robots include South Korea, with 531 per 10,000 employees, Japan with 305 and Germany with 301. The United States ranks eighth with 176. China is well behind with only 49, but on the bright side — arguably — it had the world’s fastest-growing robot population. \\nToday, population trends are the most powerful force shaping the rise and fall of nations, the starting point of any discussion about an economy’s prospects. Most of the world is graying fast, and the economic answer to aging will be all hands on deck, no matter what they’re made of. Researchers describe the ‘emotional chatting machine’ as a first attempt at the problem of creating machines that can fully understand user emotion \\nAn “emotional chatting machine” has been developed by scientists, signalling the approach of an era in which human-robot interactions are seamless and go beyond the purely functional. \\nThe chatbot, developed by a Chinese team, is seen as a significant step towards the goal of developing emotionally sophisticated robots. \\nThe ECM, as it is known for short, was able to produce factually coherent answers whilst also imbuing its conversation with emotions such as happiness, sadness or disgust. \\nProf Björn Schuller, a computer scientist at Imperial College London who was not involved in the latest advance, described the work as “an important step” towards personal assistants that could read the emotional undercurrent of a conversation and respond with something akin to empathy. \\n“This will be the next generation of intelligence to be met in daily experience, sooner rather than later,” he said. \\nThe paper found that 61% of humans who tested the machine favoured the emotional versions to the neutral chatbot. Similar results have been found in so-called “Wizard of Oz” studies in which a human typing responses masquerades as advanced AI. \\n“It is not a question whether they are desirable – they clearly are – but in which applications they make sense and where they don’t,” said Schuller. \\nMinlie Huang, a computer scientist at Tsinghua University, Beijing and co-author, said: “We’re still far away from a machine that can fully understand the user’s emotion. This is just the first attempt at this problem.” \\nHuang and colleagues started by creating an “emotion classifying” algorithm that learned to detect emotion from 23,000 posts taken from the Chinese social media site Weibo. The posts had been manually classified by humans as sad, happy and so on. \\nThe emotion classifier was then used to tag millions of social media interactions according to emotional content. This huge dataset served as a training ground for the chatbot to learn both how to answer questions and how to express emotion. \\nThe resulting program could be switched into five possible modes – happy, sad, angry, disgusted, liking – depending on the user’s preference. In one example conversation a user typed in: “Worst day ever. I arrived late because of the traffic.” \\nIn neutral mode, the chatbot droned: “You were late”. Alternative responses were: “Sometimes life just sucks!” (disgust mode), “I am always here to support you” (liking) or “Keep smiling! Things will get better” (happy – or, some might say, annoyingly chipper). \\nIn the future, the team predict the software could also learn the appropriate emotion to express at a given time. “It could be mostly empathic,” said Huang, adding that a challenge would be to avoid the chatbot reinforcing negative feelings such as rage. \\nUntil recently chatbots were widely regarded as a sideshow to more serious attempts at tackling machine intelligence. A chatbot known as Eugene Goostman managed to convince some judges they were talking to a human – but only by posing as a 13-year old Ukrainian boy with a limited grasp of English. Microsoft’s disastrous chatbot Tay was supposed to learn to chat from Twitter interactions, but was terminated after becoming a genocide-supporting Nazi less than 24 hours after being let loose on the internet. \\nThe latest study shows that chatbots, driven by a machine learning approach, are starting to make significant headway. Sandra Wachter, a computer scientist at the Oxford Internet Institute, said that in future such algorithms are likely to be personalised. “Some of us prefer a tough-love pep talk, others prefer someone to rant with,” she said. “Humans often struggle with appropriate responses because of the complexity of emotions, so building technologies that could decipher accurately our ‘emotional code’ would be very impressive.” \\nAs the stilted computer interactions of today are replaced by something approaching friendly chit-chat, new risks could be encountered. \\nOne concern is the potential for technology designed to seduce the user into sharing sensitive personal data. “It could be that children share insights with their ‘artificial friends’ and this data might be stored,” said Wachter. “What if we were to find out that people are more likely to buy more products when they are angry, sad, or bored? The ability to detect these emotions and successfully manipulate them could be a very interesting tool for companies.” \\nThere is also the potential for users to become emotionally dependent, or even romantically involved, with their computers. \\n“However, there is also a huge potential for good, such as existing software to teach children on the autism spectrum [about] emotional and social interaction,” said Schuller. “One has to carefully balance benefits and risks and ensure the best exploitation.”'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":55}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MvbFMWohG-_e","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1596648738411,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":24216,"user":{"displayName":"Roberto

taxi-hailing company Uber brings into very sharp focus the question of whether corporations can be said to have a moral character. If any human being were to behave with the single-minded and ruthless greed of the company, we would consider them sociopathic. Uber wanted to know as much as possible about the people who use its service, and those who don’t. It has an arrangement with unroll.me, a company which offered a free service for unsubscribing from junk mail, to buy the contacts unroll.me customers had had with rival taxi companies. Even if their email was notionally anonymised, this use of it was not something the users had bargained for. Beyond that, it keeps track of the phones that have been used to summon its services even after the original owner has sold them, attempting this with Apple’s phones even thought it is forbidden by the company. \\nUber has also tweaked its software so that regulatory agencies that the company regarded as hostile would, when they tried to hire a driver, be given false reports about the location of its cars. Uber management booked and then cancelled rides with a rival taxi-hailing company which took their vehicles out of circulation. Uber deny this was the intention. The punishment for this behaviour was negligible. Uber promised not to use this “greyball” software against law enforcement – one wonders what would happen to someone carrying a knife who promised never to stab a policeman with it. Travis Kalanick of Uber got a personal dressing down from Tim Cook, who runs Apple, but the company did not prohibit the use of the app. Too much money was at stake for that. \\nMillions of people around the world value the cheapness and convenience of Uber’s rides too much to care about the lack of drivers’ rights or pay. Many of the users themselves are not much richer than the drivers. The “sharing economy” encourages the insecure and exploited to exploit others equally insecure to the profit of a tiny clique of billionaires. Silicon Valley’s culture seems hostile to humane and democratic values. The outgoing CEO of Yahoo, Marissa Mayer, who is widely judged to have been a failure, is likely to get a $186m payout. This may not be a cause for panic, any more than the previous hero worship should have been a cause for euphoria. Yet there’s an urgent political task to tame these companies, to ensure they are punished when they break the law, that they pay their taxes fairly and that they behave responsibly.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":61}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"X68ELJQgIG48","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":272},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1596648743849,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":29585,"user":{"displayName":"Roberto Porto Benatti","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgcmEmdm2HYZegiZDSIJBTrhAOw70X8Joz46fI2MA=s64","userId":"13029827141703952410"}},"outputId":"65abd005-1f0d-4e4b-e49e-370174f9c85a"},"source":["# Instantiate the English model: nlp\n","nlp = spacy.load('en', tagger=False, parse=False, matcher=False)\n","\n","# Create a new document: doc\n","doc = nlp(article)\n","\n","# Print all of the found entities and their labels\n","for ent in doc.ents:\n","    print(ent.label_, ent.text)"],"execution_count":62,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["ORG Uber\n","PERSON Uber\n","ORG unroll.me\n","ORG Apple\n","PERSON Uber\n","PERSON Travis Kalanick\n","PERSON Uber\n","PERSON Tim Cook\n","ORG Apple\n","CARDINAL Millions\n","PERSON Uber\n","LOC Silicon Valley\n","ORG Yahoo\n","PERSON Marissa Mayer\n","MONEY $186m\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2OFFWr0FIaHj","colab_type":"text"},"source":["### Multilingual NER with polyglot"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"V0SqZ6KtId3d","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**French NER with polyglot I**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WhTPoS9oLY2H","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":171},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1596648743850,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":29573,"user":{"displayName":"Roberto Porto Benatti","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgcmEmdm2HYZegiZDSIJBTrhAOw70X8Joz46fI2MA=s64","userId":"13029827141703952410"}},"outputId":"d29c5857-0f01-4806-e251-6a9e73d3a320"},"source":["article = news[1]\n","article"],"execution_count":63,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\"édition abonné \\nDans une tribune au « Monde », l’universitaire Charles Cuvelliez estime que le fantasme d’un remplacement de l’homme par l’algorithme et le robot repose sur un malentendu. \\nLe Monde | 10.05.2017 à 06h44 • Mis à jour le 10.05.2017 à 09h47 | Par Charles Cuvelliez (Professeur à l’Ecole polytechnique de l'université libre de Bruxelles) \\nTRIBUNE. L’usage morbide, par certains, de Facebook Live a amené son fondateur à annoncer précipitamment le recrutement de 3 000 modérateurs supplémentaires. Il est vrai que l’intelligence artificielle (IA) est bien en peine de reconnaître des contenus violents, surtout diffusés en direct. \\nLe quotidien affreux de ces modérateurs, contraints de visionner des horreurs à longueur de journée, mériterait pourtant qu’on les remplace vite par des machines ! \\nL’IA ne peut pas tout, mais là où elle peut beaucoup, on la maudit, accusée de détruire nos emplois, de remplacer la convivialité humaine. Ce débat repose sur un malentendu. \\nIl vient d’une définition de l’IA qui n’a, dans la réalité, jamais pu être mise en pratique : en 1955, elle était vue comme la création de programmes informatiques qui, quoi qu’on leur confie, le feraient un jour mieux que les humains. On pensait que toute caractéristique de l’intelligence humaine pourrait un jour être si précisément décrite qu’il suffirait d’une machine pour la simuler. Ce n’est pas vrai. \\nAngoisses infondées \\nComme le dit un récent Livre blanc sur la question (Pourquoi il ne faut pas avoir peur de l’Intelligence arti\\xadficielle, Julien Maldonato, Deloitte, mars 2017), rien ne pourra remplacer un humain dans sa globalité. \\nL’IA, c’est de l’apprentissage automatique doté d’un processus d’ajustement de modèles statistiques à des masses de données, explique l’auteur. Il s’agit d’un apprentissage sur des paramètres pour lesquels une vision humaine n’explique pas pourquoi ils marchent si bien dans un contexte donné. \\nC’est aussi ce que dit le rapport de l’Office parlementaire d’évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques (« Pour une intelligence artificielle maîtrisée, utile et démystifiée », 29 mars 2017), pour qui ce côté « boîte noire » explique des angoisses infondées.
